I also loved seeing Tommy Flanagan in a small role here, as I love his current work in the TV series \"Sons of Anarchy\". Another plus for this film was certainly the screenplay. Tons of quotable lines and great speeches really helped to amplify this film. My complaints would likely center around the forced and unnecessary romance. It did not help move the film forward in the least. In terms of providing character history, it works, but as the action unfolds, it no longer really serves a purpose and felt like excess. In addition, the aforementioned slow beginning sequence was not overly to my liking, though I certainly understand why it is there and cannot complain over its conclusion. It simply did not provide the necessary spark to grab the viewers attention in my mind, but regardless, its importance is clear. Other than that, while typically top-notch, the CGI at times was noticeable with some unrealistic deaths along the way, but that is to be expected, as no film is perfect.

The story feels dragged and at some points loses all interest in itself, taking away the focus from the \"main promotion\" of the film i.e. the gladiator aspect and sides more with the stale conspiracies and uninteresting characters that control them. Yes, the gladiator games are well choreographed full of action and excitement, but there is a serious lack of it in my opinion, especially for a film that is named \"Gladiator\" and features the main character who becomes a gladiator and participates in the gladiator games should have a predominate feature in the games. Obviously not in this case, this isn't criticism, I just don't understand why the political aspect has to be so major. The soundtrack to this film is one of the best scores produced by Hans Zimmer; especially towards the end. Plus the acting from Russell Crowe as Maximus is fantastic and easily brings the best role here alive with only one other actor Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus coming into the only other position of 2nd place seeing as he is really the only other developed character, not to mention that the rivalry between them is brilliantly played out even if Commodus character falls a little flat, becoming a rather alienated and brash person when it comes to decision making, but Phoenix does a great job of being paranoid. Generally all other characters seem just to fall short of this even through the script is great and well written it doesn't justify any other characters other than Maximus and Commodus, with the exception of Proximo, Lucille and Marcus but they just aren't developed enough to care but Richard Harris does deliver a fine performance. I have to say that the cinematography is amazing in this film, the CGI has stood the test of time and although some scenery and deaths look a bit...well patchy. I have to say the mise-un-scene compliments the ancient Rome style very well and even looks like it was filmed in the original robes. This film isn't a bad film at all, I found it very good, I think that Ridley Scott has made a fine film which has great acting, a decent/fairly interesting story, a well written script and perfect cinematography.

The plot takes you to a world that is possible to imagine and is so easily and well done that you could almost believe that the movie was in fact shot in Ancient Rome. It's so expertly written that I have watched it dozens of times and still enjoy every moment of it. The story adds to the setting, character development, and overall feel of the movie. It's an amazing film as far as storytelling goes. As for the acting I can even appreciate the main villain. He comes off as a whining, simpering lunatic with quite a lot of daddy issues. Most of the time the villain is the one person I find most uninteresting, but this time I did find him interesting and due to this wanted him to die so hard. As for the main role, played by Russel Crowe, Maximus is just the guy. He's the one guy I'd want in case of zombie outbreak. Batman is well and good, but Maximus is better. Batman can abandon you and go and fight the zombies by himself and then when he returns to you he can sit there and do some detective work to try and figure out why leaving you by yourself got you killed. While Maximus will ensure the survival of you, your friends, the kid with you, the dog, the cat, and the donkey you've all got following you. In short...best cinema hero ever. A believable hero too. The settings are just amazing and really suck you into the film. Every piece, every segment looks like something you would see in Ancient Rome. From the coliseum to the streets of Rome you're made to believe that they're all in an accurately depicted ancient civilization. Not to mention the costuming also plays a big role in giving you that feel. No one is dressed out of place and the costumes due the timeline and the movie honest justice. The music is amazing, and it stands out when it needs to, and fades to the back when it needs to. They did very well on that part and unlike many movies that just like to park trumpets in your face and blow your eardrums up this one has none of that. They did their music well and come on...I love Enya. In the end this is a beautiful, touching, gorgeous movie that's all heart. It had me crying my eyeballs out, and also got me thrilled.

It also immortalizes, above all, director Ridley Scott.Roger Ebert complains of people with short memory spans praising this film while forgetting that films like Spartacus have supposedly done this before. Well, I have a good memory, and I remember Spartacus. In fact, I kept on remembering that film while watching Gladiator, only in the context of, \"This is so much better than Spartacus. It goes beyond.\" The action is better, the visuals are better, the story is better, and the acting is better. Sorry, Kirk.Since this is an action film, the story isn't the most important element, but for an action film it is actually quite good. For one thing, I liked the disturbing under-the-surface incest element going on between Commodus and Connie Nielson. Furthermore, it was interesting to see how Crowe gained support among the gladiators until it became as if he were a general leading his army again. The plot itself needed to be there in order to fully create a sense of grandeur. With its insurrection story, the rise of the hero and his trek to the capitol of Rome, and the look at the people in power, the plot creates a sense of time-and-place necessary for an epic that couldn't exist with the visuals and action alone.The acting is among the best one can ever seen for an action film, and there is plenty of fine dramatic work pulled off by the two main actors. Russell Crowe is now one of the best \"new\" (four or five films so far) actors in film. We believe, in his glances and the ways he delivers his many great lines, that he is Maximus. He is poignant, hate-filled, and sorrowful all at once. The praise he is getting is deserved. But why isn't Phoenix being lauded just as much? He carries the film in the second-largest role just as well as Crowe. His Emperor Commodus isn't a good villain and has no real character, but Phoenix adds so many layers to him and turns him into a great antagonist that that alone makes his performance excellent. He commands attention just as Crowe does. All by himself (no help from any great dialogue or development), he creates a villain that is prissy, whining, ambitious, pathetic, and malevolent, and worthy of our hate as well as our pity. It's a wonderful transformation. To sum it up, the characters themselves aren't really developed at all- but the acting is so good that it seems they are.Now, onto the action, which, as I had hoped, is plentiful and intense. It has diversity and grandeur. All the fights were fast, hard-hitting, uncensored, and very bloody, which is what they should've been like. And every single fight sequence is unique from the others. There's the match where two men fought chained to each other, the opening war battle, Maximus vs. numerous other fighters, and the final sword duel, to name a few. This is so much more than just two half-naked men fighting with swords, which is what it could've been. The film also captures the feel and the motion of combat. Ridley Scott speeds up the film slightly during fight scenes to show the chaos and rapid reflexes necessary to survive. During the fight scenes, the camerawork is nonstop and covers the combat as one big blur to the fighters. (But we can still follow the fights themselves.)This film also stands out in my mind as one of the most visual, image-driven action films I've ever seen. Thanks to Ridley Scott, practically every scene is jammed with wonderful detail, art direction, even distinct lighting (the Collosseum orange, other parts of Rome dark blue). Just look at the wide multitude (seemingly infinite number) of battle masks, weapons, and locales. Cinematography is skillful and impressive. There are tons of memorable shots, like Maximus entering the ring with rose petals coming down on him like rain from above, Commodus' pure white battle costume (when he's being risen up on the platform he looks like a demented angel ascending to heaven), and the images used to represent Crowe's home- the gentle hand carressing the wheat reeds, the door to his house, etc. They had a surreal quality and each were bathed in their own distinct color. Excellent work, Ridley.A very impressive film. So why can't all summer movies be this good?

I should let you know that I tried to get the discs from Paramount directly. They're usually very helpful and responsive in such situations, but they genuinely don't seem to have them available to send them out until early next week, for whatever reason. Given the controversy around the Net regarding the Gladiator transfer, however, I still wanted to be able to see the discs today myself - rather than comment on all this screenshot silliness - to make my own judgments and report here in time for you all to have fair warning prior to street date (9/1 - this coming Tuesday). It's your money, and you want to spend it wisely. You need information in order to do that.Let me first comment on the whole issue of screenshots. Judging a disc based on a few screenshots is, I think, silly. A screenshot represents 1/24 of a second of film. For a 2-hour film, that just 1/172,800th of the total visual information. You just can't properly judge a transfer based upon that little information. Screenshots CAN be illustrative of various kinds of image-related problems. But you really have to see the image in full motion to judge the complete context and impact of anything you see in a single frame grab. There's also the problem of potential alterations or artifacts that result from the frame-grabbing process itself, not to mention any changes resulting from image compression/editing software used by the poster - no matter how well intentioned - to present the frame-grab online. Finally, I've seen enough deliberately Photoshop doctored frame-grabs posted in discussion forums in my day that I just don't trust them. Ultimately, the only real way to judge these things properly is with your own eyes, first-hand, in context, in full motion, presented on proper equipment. Period.That being the case, an exhaustive search of retailers and rentailers in my area turned up a \"mom and pop\" rental shop nearby that had both Blu-ray titles available for rent prior to street date. I was able to pick up the discs this morning, and I've since gone through the transfers in some detail. I'm not going to talk about the extras - I'll do that in more detail next week, and I can tell you with confidence that the extras on both discs are absolutely first-rate. No complaints there whatsoever. As for the A/V quality, however, here's my two cents...Upon first glance, and as expected, the HD presentation quality of Gladiator isn't as bad as some online would have you believe. Color and contrast is fine at all times. The problem is with the level of detail. The vast majority of the film has a slightly digital-looking quality to it, and there's clear edge-enhancement \"haloing\" visible. The extended edition scenes, however, look fine - no halos, no digital patina - they're very natural looking. If the whole film looked like the extended scenes, we wouldn't be having this conversation. What it looks like to me, is that someone at Universal (keep in mind, it's Universal that controls the Gladiator assets for DreamWorks - not Paramount), decided to re-use the original digital master of the HD transfer done back in 2000 for the very first DVD release. Now, that transfer was state of the art for its day, and it was approved by director Ridley Scott, but obviously it's a far cry from the quality of new HD transfers done today, in 2009. One of the biggest problems is that until fairly recently, video mastering engineers were still applying edge-enhancement to their digital masters knowing that they were going to be used ultimately for standard-definition DVD release, and also analog VHS and laserdisc. It took the mastering community a long time to break the habit. In this Gladiator transfer, you can see it in the image. It's also clear that the 2000 digital master has been digitally-filtered to reduce the haloing and other artifacts - the signs of DNR are not hard to miss. That's in contrast to the extended edition scenes, which were transferred in HD in 2005 and so look much better. They're still not quite up to today's standards, but they look far superior to the rest of the film and there's no edge-enhancement or obvious filtering visible. The footage simply looks natural - as it should. There's been some talk of DNR being so excessive that - for example - arrows and fireballs disappear from one frame to the next. This IS an issue, but the fact is that when you watch the image in full motion it's not something you really notice. The arrow or fireball is highly visible in one frame, less so in the next, more so in the third, etc. You still detect the object in motion, so you don't go, \"Oh my god, that fireball just disappeared!\" The image just looks generally digital and lacking in fine detail. Overall, I would grade the A/V quality of the Gladiator Blu-ray thusly:GladiatorVideo: 15.5 (theatrical footage)/17 (extended scenes)Audio: 18Let me be clear: Gladiator on Blu-ray is quite watchable - especially if you have a smaller screen. On the comparative grading scale we use for Blu-ray, the very best DVD video and audio quality would be graded a 10. So it's definitely an improvement over the previous DVD releases. The problem is, the best Blu-rays - most high-quality titles on the format these days - score in the 18-19 range. So while this disc is watchable, that's just not good enough, either for the format as a whole or for most fans and enthusiasts", :rating=>2.0, :percentage=>40.0, :useful=>[31, 35], :date=>" 2009 August 28", :title=>"bleech", :location=>"(Sin City, Nevada)", :username=>"4EverYoung", :source=>{:vendor=>"amazon", :url=>"http://www.amazon.com/Gladiator-Signature-Selection-Two-Disc-Collectors/product-reviews/B00003CXE7"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"<Complete excerpt from review on digitalbits.com> for which I wholey trust and respect the opinion of Bill Hunt, editor.Okay... so, I've seen Gladiator and Braveheart on Blu-ray this afternoon.", :clean_text=>"complete excerpt from review on digitalbitscom for which i wholey trust and respect the opinion of bill hunt editorokay so ive seen gladiator and braveheart on bluray this afternoon", :sentiment=>{:average=>0.35, :corrected_average=>0.19, :scores=>[0.1, 0.42, 0.24, 0.64], :total=>1.4, :weighted_total=>1.4}, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"I should let you know that I tried to get the discs from Paramount directly.", :clean_text=>"i should let you know that i tried to get the discs from paramount directly", :sentiment=>{:average=>0.28625, :corrected_average=>0.08, :scores=>[0.0, 0.83, 0.095, 0.22], :total=>1.145, :weighted_total=>0.0}, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>2, :text=>"They're usually very helpful and responsive in such situations, but they genuinely don't seem to have them available to send them out until early next week, for whatever reason.", :clean_text=>"theyre usually very helpful and responsive in such situations but they genuinely dont seem to have them available to send them out until early next week for whatever reason", :sentiment=>{:average=>0.27375000000000005, :corrected_average=>0.34, :scores=>[0.4, 0.42, -0.27, 0.545], :total=>1.0950000000000002, :weighted_total=>2.1900000000000004}, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>2.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>3, :text=>"Given the controversy around the Net regarding the Gladiator transfer, however, I still wanted to be able to see the discs today myself -

There are also a number of less \"popular\" artists\nwho also deserve a big \"bravo\". Amongst them I have to mention ex-Mr\nUniverse Ralph Moeller who is mostly used as the comic relief of the\nmovie. In Gladiator we can also the beautiful and popular Maltese TV\nStar and actress Ruth Frendo, who although has a small part, she is\ntotally brilliant and outstanding.Actually I got to IMDb while I was looking for her name on the\ninternet, in fact on IMDb she has some very stunning photos. I was\nlucky to meet Ruth Frendo whilst she was filming in another Maltese\nproduction. Ruth Frendo is not only a gorgeous and talented actress but\nshe is also amazingly intelligent and very down-to-earth. We will\ndefinitely be seeing more of her work in the future... The scenery used for \"Gladiator\" is brilliant \u0096 and the opening battle\nscene is definitely one of my top favorite scenes. The modern camera\ntechnique contrasts sharply to the brutality of the gladiators actions\nand blood shed during the movie; and I love the light contrasts thanks\nto the lenses which most definitely have been used to create a surreal\nfeel to the entire movie.\"Gladiator\" deserves all the awards and great reviews it has received,\nand for those of you who still haven't gone and watched it \u0096 I can\nassure you that it will be well worth your time and money.

Great Writing!  Great Acting!  Great Directing!  Great Score!\nThis movie has it all.  I especially enjoyed the mood of the film.

The movie flows effortlessly from scene\nto scene, while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and\nnail-biting excitement.The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations.  Russell Crowe\nis brilliant in his role as Maximus, the \"general who became a slave, who\nbecame a gladiator, who defied an emperor.\"  Crowe's intense style is\nperfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus.  Joaquin\nPhoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus, the corrupt emperor.\nHe plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by\nshowing certain vulnerable or fragile sides, while at the same time\ninstantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character\nshine.  It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works\nperfectly with his role.Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla.  However, perhaps the two\nfinest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans\nin supporting roles.  Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in\nwhat will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their\ncareers.  Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius, the aging Caesar who\nreflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And\nReed, especially, gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as\nProximo, the trainer for the gladiators.  The way he spoke about the life of\na gladiator, the splendor of Rome, and the \"thrill of the Coliseum\" really\nadded excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see\nmore than once to fully appreciate.  The excitement felt for me when Rome is\nfirst shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene.  But the\nwhole movie is a rush!  Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to\ncapture the different moods in the movie.  Ridley Scott sets the perfect\ntone with his artistic and creative directing.

The dying\nemperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius, is watching this battle.The emperor's son, Commodus, then arrives with his sister Lucilla, and it is\ndiscovered that Commodus fully expects to be announced the new emperor of\nRome in a few days. Aurelius, however, has other plans--he wants to make\nMaximus emperor, and requests that of the general, who wants nothing more\nthan to go home to his family.I went into this movie having just watched Ben-Hur in my film studies class\nand having watched an episode of Xena only a couple of weeks earlier that\nfeatured the story of Marc Anthony and Cleopatra. So you could say I was in\nthe perfect mindset to watch a \"sword-and-sandal\" movie. I wasn't sure what\nto expect, having somehow avoided all the hype that accompanied this movie.\nBut I was not disappointed.Gladiator features some wonderful cinematography by John Mathieson. The\nbattle scenes are very graphic. (This movie is not for the squeamish, that's\nfor sure.) There were some scenes in particular that really struck me, such\nas when Crowe appears to be floating over the ground very fast.  The use of\ncolor and color tones added a great deal to the mood of the movie.\nExcellent.The script was being written and re-written as the filming was going on, yet\nit doesn't show that the actors had no idea how the movie was going to end\nwhen they began filming.  The acting is terrific. Russell Crowe is\nwonderfully cast as Maximus. Many reviewers agree that he is now officially\na star. Joaquin Phoenix also proves his mettle as the emotionally troubled\nCommodus, whose behavior and emotion toward his sister could give anyone the\ncreeps. Connie Nielsen makes you believe that, as Lucilla, she really is\ntorn between natural loyalty to her brother and doing what she knows is\nright. Oliver Reed, in his last performance, is memorable in his role of\nProximo, the former gladiator who is the owner of Maximus and brings him to\nRome.  In short, the actors were brilliant in their roles, not over-acting,\nbut giving subtle, strong performances.The script itself is very good.  Although some elements are a little hard to\nbelieve--the fact that no one recognizes Maximus when he's a slave?--this\nfilm calls for a willing suspension of disbelief, which one would happily\ncomply with.  (It's really no fun to nitpick such a movie.)It's true that this movie does pretty much follow the Braveheart formula.\nHowever, this movie includes some elements, such as the cinematography and\nthe incredibly graphic battle scenes (one reviewer likened it to Saving\nPrivate Ryan, \"only better\"), that are spectacular in itself. Overall, a\ngreat movie that I highly recommend.\n\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172495/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"\n\nThe movie is the story of

21st Century's answer to Cecil B\nDeMille, Ridley Scott and his dramatic tale of courage and revenge,\nGLADIATOR - \"the general who became a slave, the slave who became a\ngladiator, the gladiator who defied an emperor\".Once a great roman General, and as good as adopted son of Marcus Aurelius\nCaesar (Harris), Maximus (Crowe) is forced into exile by Commodus (Phoenix),\nheir to the throne, after the death of Marcus. Saved from death by slavers,\nhe is purchased for use as a gladiator by Proximo (Reed) and ends up in the\narena of all arena's, the Colloseum, where he proves unbeatable under his\nguise as \"The Spaniard\".And with a budget of over $100m, Scott certainly delivers the goods.\nGLADIATOR transcends the notion of 'blockbuster' that we have become\naccustomed to in the age of electronic and special effects wizardry and\ninstead offers a good old fashioned action film along the lines of Spartacus\nand and Ben Hur. Not only are we drawn into an archetypal story that\ncontains all the classic elements a filmgoer could dream of (love, loss,\ncourage, despair, good triumphing over evil etc etc) - also on offer is a\nvisual feast of cinematic painting after painting - a rich tapestry of\nimages that are breathtaking and ultimately visually satisfying. From the\nplains of Germania, to the desert stronghold of Zuchobar, and finally to\ngreat Rome herself, John Mathiesion, the cinematographer is to be commended\nhighly for his general inventiveness and ability to capture so much on film.\nThe opening  battle scene is superb as a cast of thousands erupt across the\nscreen and provide an indication that we are about to see a film that pays\nincredible attention to detail throughout its entirety. In every way, Scott\nhas created a world for us that scuttles films of similar epic undertakings\n(and budgets!) and sends them to their dooms at the bottom of the murky\ndepths of film history where they belong.The cast is generally very strong. Crowe proves himself very suitable to the\ntask with a great\nemotional range and depth of character. His accent ocassionally bugged me\n(as did the mish mash of accents on offer - but that is I guess a legacy of\n'internationally casted films'), but this aside, he was well and truly up to\nthe task. Phoenix is also excellent as the disturbed Commodus, as is Nielson\nas Lucilla, the daughter of Marcus who \"should have been a son\" and finds\nherself torn between loyalty to her brother and doing what is 'right'. The\nold guard thesps of Harris, Reed and Jacobi (Grachus) are uniformly strong\nas supporting characters, and Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) does a fine job\nas the young heir to the throne.Add to this great cast excellent editing and post production work, and an\nintricate soundscape (including a magnificent Hans Zimmer score), and you\nhave a film that, despite its length, was highly palatable and had me in\nthere from beginning to end.

I'd have to say that anyone who likes Ridley Scott (I sure\ndo) should see this. It is a lot like Ridley's other movies (Black Hawk Down\nwas also amazing). If you can stand a little bit--well, ok a LOT of blood\nand gore, then you should see this. Russell Crowe shows an excellent\nperformance like no other. I don't think there's one bad movie that Ridley\nScott has made or that Russell Crowe has acted in. The fact that the brutal\nbattles involving innocent slaves in this film actually happened in real\nlife centuries ago makes it even more interesting and powerful. Emperor\nCommodus is a truely evil and life-like villian who shows a lot of his wits\nin attempts to get his revenge against Maximus.Ridley Scott went to many different locations to shoot this film to make it\nreal, and he does. The film is set in Rome, and it looks just like it. You\nfeel as if you are there in the crowd, hearing them cheer and cheer to see\nthe death. To some of you, this may sound a little barbaric, and believe me\nthe film is VERY barbaric and brutual, however it teaches a very strong\nlesson of what happens when an economy turns as violent as Rome was. Ridley\nScott goes to many lengths to make this movie real, because even though the\ncharacters are fictitious, all of this really did happen. Innocent people\nhad to go through brutual fighting while thousands of people cheered for\neither their death or the enemy's death. If you were an inexperienced\nfighter, chances are you would get killed. But the strange thing is that\nRome LOVED this. People came from all over to see these fights and to see\nthe blood that was shed, that is why you can't blame the characters in this\nfilm for being so forlorn and saddened the whole time. The film itself is\nvery dark. The theme is dark and the ending is dark. From beginning to end\nthere is excessive violence (for those action movie-goers, this is a movie\nfor you). But if the violence is concerning you, don't let it. The special\neffects make the movie great, but it's the acting and storyline that make it\nspectacular.

It went on to win 5 Oscars (including Best Picture) and received a further 7 nominations. This only added to my feelings of resentment towards it.As a result, I chose to avoid seeing it again and didn't mince my words on my dislike for it. However, plenty of people - who's opinions I respect - seemed to love it. For that reason, I chose to have a reappraisal. During the days of the Roman Empire, dedicated soldier Maximus (Russell Crowe) loyally serves the emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). When the emperor is killed, Maximus refuses to transfer his loyalty to his son and new emperor, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and suffers the consequences. He is ordered to be killed but manages to escape, ending up in the hands of slave trader Proximo (Oliver Reed), who pits him into the Roman Colosseum as a gladiator. It's here that Maximus realises he can still use the arena and the crowd to his benefit and plan his revenge on Commodus. On only my second viewing of this film, my opinion has changed and changed for the better. I still have issues with it but it's granduer is undeniably impressive and as a slice of entertainment it can't be faulted. I can honestly admit now, that my scornful opinion of this film was slightly unjust. It was much better than I remember but still not the classic it's proclaimed to be. For a start, it has a high tendency for melodrama. This is acceptable in some cases but with the acclimations that Gladiator has recieved over the years, I find it needs to be scrutinised a little further. One of the main causes for it's melodramatic approach is some ridiculous dialogue. Reportedly, during production Russell Crowe himself had complaints with screenwriter William Nicholson's dialogue, apparently telling him it was \"garbage\". I found that to be the case in several scenes and when delivering it, the uncomfortableness in the actors looked apparent. However, they manage to carry it well enough; Crowe is a commanding presence in his Oscar winning role but it's by no means his best performance. I think his abilities were better tested the year before in \"The Insider\", where he was absolutely superb and deserved the Oscar then. Phoenix is another actor I admire and he also delivers a good performance but unfortunately suffers with a poorly written and stereotypical character. He's no more than a cartoon villain - complete with dark eye shadow - and he couldn't really get any more nasty. Old hands, Harris and Reed phone their performances in and it looks as if Reed is just there for the beer tokens. Jacobi, however brief, shows his thespian abilities and the always excellent Djimon Hounsou is wasted in another poorly written role. There's not a lot going on for the character's as ultimately, this is all about the spectacle. And a fine, grandiose one it is. With \"Blade Runner\" and most recently \"Prometheus\", Scott has never been known to scrimp on the visual front and this is no different. It is exquisitely detailed (kudos to cinematographer John Mathieson) and filmed in the grandest of scales. The director can't be faulted in his ability to capture the hearts and minds of an audience and this is no more apparent than the impressively choreographed battle scenes and wonderfully ethereal afterlife sequences - shot with a highly artistic eye. Such scenes are afforded a greater power by a superb score from Hans Zimmer and the amazing vocal talents of Lisa Gerrard (for those unaware, check out her beautiful work with Australian outfit \"Dead Can Dance\"). On a visual and audio front, this film can't be reckoned with but unfortunately, I found it to succumb to formula. Despite the fact that the real life Commodus did actually fight in the the gladiatorial arena, the ending stretched credulity for me but I suppose dramatic license is commonplace in film's of this type. I enjoyed this a far-sight more than I used to, as it's undeniably epic and visually arresting. Essentially though, this is an action movie. A good one but not much more than an action movie dressed in the Emperor's clothes.", :title=>nil, :location=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"rotten_tomatoes",
