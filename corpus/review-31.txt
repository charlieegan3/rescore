In today's world, there are not many ways we have come up with in terms of communication that does not include WORDS. In fact if anything, our society have come up with the most high tech, intriguing ways of communication using words such as Facebook, the I phone, and text/instant messaging. Saying this I must admit, that after watching Wall-E, I was more impressed with this film and it's achievements than any other film I have seen in the last few years.Without language, Wall-E achieved emotion, quirky personalities, and the development of friendship and love. ALL WITHOUT WORDS. Quite an amazing feat. I was in tears at the end of this excellent Pixar film and could not believe how incredibly attached I had become to Wall-E and Eva, the two main characters. I was astonished.Pixar has created a masterpiece that will be remembered as a true breakthrough in animation and I am so thrilled that children of today and tomorrow will be able to watch a film that has such vitally important messages about how to live, respecting Mother Earth, and being conscientious about your environment and community.Within this thoroughly entertaining film, there is such a unique message of hope for all of mankind. All the men, women, and children of the world have an effect on this incredible planet that we all depend on. It is a delicate balance that we must respect and continue to teach the next generations of how important it is to do our part, no matter how small - Recycling, turning off all the lights before going out or going to bed, donating used clothing and other products to organizations like the Red Cross and the Salvation Army. The treasured plant in the shoe that Wall-E finds and keeps is a symbol of how blessed we are to have such a beautiful and wonderful planet. The different vegetation and flowers, the animal kingdom, and the beautiful landscapes that differ from the golden deserts of the Sahara to the lush, tropical jungles in South America, to the beautiful blue-green of the Mediterranean Sea. These inspiring and realizations all came to me after watching this film. A+
