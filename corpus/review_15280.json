  "body": " -Focus (2015) movie review: -Focus is a crime flick that follows con-man Nicky, played by Will Smith, as he meets and trains a new counterpart Jess, played by Margot Robbie, in the ways of being a con-artist. This comes complete with twists, trust issues, rich people, and all kinds of Oceans 11 style problems.  -For what it was, I really enjoyed Focus. It has a few small problems, but was good.  -The story felt original and was hard to predict, making the twists even better and more shocking. Even if they were a tiny bit forced.  -The pace was really good for the first half, and the second half. But the first half is all fun and the second half is all plot. Neither was bad, but the second half was less fun.  -The acting is really good. Both Will and Margot did a great job! -The characters are deep and interesting. Will Smiths character especially had a lot to offer in the way of charisma and twists.  -The music was fitting and some of it was memorable.  -Another thing I liked was seeing the inside of the whole con-man thing you see in movies. Like stealing watches looks so much cooler in this because they explain it.  -Really the negatives are small. There are some inconsistencies and some added drama that takes the audience out of reality alittle, but it was compelling, well-made, and entertaining! There is not that much else to say, because Focus is worth seeing in theaters! -It is rated-R for some language, a moderate, but not heavy amount, and some brief sexual content. A PG-13 amount probably.",
