i saw this movie with my sister at the drive-in when i visited her over 4th Of July weekend. we both liked it. in my opinion it was one of the best disney CGI movies since TOY STORY 1 and 2. it had a very good story about how Earth was abandoned after becoming too polluted to sustain human life. Enter WALL*E a lone robot on earth who spends his days clearing out trash until he meets EVA. not to give away the plot things begin to happen for the humans on board a sort of Noah's Ark type spacecraft when WALL*E gives EVA a plant that he's been caring for in a boot during his down time.
