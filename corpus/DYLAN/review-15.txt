Another 'has been' director that should quit making movies. Whoever gave him the money for this should be arrested and their assets frozen for all time. Judging by the number of people with me in the theater who got up and left this will probably and hopefully be the last anderson film ever. I love this guy, 'hard eight', 'boogie nights' and 'magnolia' were great films. 'magnolia' were great films. 'magnolia' is hard to watch but it's at the top of my favorites. Everything about the movie is genius. But this movie looks like a bunch of bored, rich actors run amuck. The movie is insulting and I'm not sure if that wasn't really the point. To make a great movie you have to get about a 100 things right all at once. This movie is 0 for 100. It's not just that it's not funny or entertaining. It's nothing. Or, maybe I just wasn't stoned enough ....not sure if there is enough weed in cali to make up for it though.
