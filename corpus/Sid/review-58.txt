A poor excuse for a finale to the Hobbit trilogy. Although I feel that the other two films were also rather weak, Jackson's failings as a storyteller really come into their own in The Battle of the Five Armies. The film is little more than a showy collection of battle scenes and special effects that drown a poor screenplay, and in themselves are as tiring as they are bloated and pointless.A poor excuse for a finale to the Hobbit trilogy.

Emotionally uninvolving, uninspiring and entirely forgettable: give me Jackson's old splatstick any day of the week!
