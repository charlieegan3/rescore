Very disappointed with this effort. Felt like Peter Jackson sold out. He was all about the integrity of the story when he started and now, in trying to reap 3 films from 1 book, he has marred his reputation. The film is 1 big fight scene from start to finish with totally implausible physical feats liberally splashed throughout. There is also an amateurish attempt to introduce a side story with Leggolas which is underdeveloped and poorly explained, possibly the product of poor editing. If money is what now drives Jackson, then he would have made more with his next lot of films if he'd preserved his reputation with this one.
