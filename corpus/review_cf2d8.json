The shark itself was awesome! The view of the water in Jaws is spooky and it makes you feel that anything can be in it! The music by John Williams is great and the direction by Steven Spielberg is terrific!Jaws has three other sequels but they aren't classics like this! If you like shark movies and haven't seen Jaws or even if you have check out Jaws today!",
