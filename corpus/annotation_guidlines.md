#Annotation Guidlines (proposed)

*v0.1*

Notes on review annotation for the *rescore* corpus.

##Review Selection
Reviews should be selected for variation in:

* Film Genre
* Length / Depth
* Assigned Score (â˜… ratings etc)
* 'Helpfulness' Scores
* Source (IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes...)

For version one of the corpus reviews and annotations should not cover:

1. Emphasis and Exaggeration
2. People & Cast
3. Negation & Double Negation
4. Sentiment & Negation that span multiple sentences

We should differ reviews with more complex language to a later iteration.

##Annotations

###Aspect Words

Current aspect list. Currently, as with sentiment, only individual words and not phrases are used.

We should also assign 'untargetted' comments at the **movie as a whole.**

###Sentiment

To reduce ambiguity we're taking sentiment values from: [sentimental](https://github.com/7compass/sentimental/blob/master/lib/sentiwords.txt). The plan is to update & refine this as we move on.

Running `ruby corpus/lookup.rb {WORD}` from the root of the project runs a simple script to get a score for the word.

##Format
Choose reviews based on the criteria in review selection.

Use `ruby corpus/annotation_assistant.rb` to guide you through the process. It will save a `.json` file at the end.
