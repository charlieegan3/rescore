  "body": "  As a fan of the Die Hard series I feel the need to warn others - Don't waste 97 minutes of your life on this movie! Yes, it really is that bad.  Here's a concise summary of why it's just so bad:  1) John McClane's role is really as a side-kick. Why do this to the big man .... why?  2) The movie lacks a bad guy. Does the movie have people that are bad - of course, but it lacks that McClane v Super-villain factor.  3) There's very little of the Die Hard humour we've all grown to love.  4) The movie parodies the Hans Gruber death sequence - never - never do this.  5) Jai Courtney is terrible. It's hard to discern if it's the role he's been asked to play or him, but either way he come across as a spoiled brat pretending to be Jason Bourne.  6) There's hardly any script - it's as if the script were sandwiched in post production to fit around the bangs and crashes.  7) It's not in the USA. This sounds trivial but it's not - the film just doesn't work outside of its tried and tested environment.  8) The car chase scene - oh my. If you do choose to watch the movie after reading this the good news is that yes, it does eventually end - although it may not feel this way.  So in summary, go plant a tree, play football, go for a walk, in fact - do anything but for the love of all that you hold dear - don't waste your life on this. ",
