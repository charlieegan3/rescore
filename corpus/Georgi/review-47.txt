The people who thought this movie was boring must have the shortest attention spans ever.  It was amazing how nicely each character was developed considering most of them only say a few words!  Wall-E is a greatly lovable character who warmed my heart the entire movie.  I highly recommend this for anyone!  The message is great, the execution is lovely, and the whole thing is greatly entertaining
