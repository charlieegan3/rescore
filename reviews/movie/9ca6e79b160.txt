I love it when people get so serious over a movie which is clearly meant to be fun! Obviously anyone who saw this will agree the acting wasn't stellar & the story was hokey by all means, but come on, based on the material it was clearly meant to be a movie to get some laughs & make you feel good. What I really liked about Paul Blart was that Kevin James showed more of a serious & even tender side to himself which we never really got to see in his TV show The King of Queens...you really wanted to see his character become truly happy in life & become the hero he always dreamed of being. And if you are a fan of The King of Queens then you also appreciate the fact that Kevin James had used some people from the show in the movie so there is a level of comfort to add to the story. All in all a very enjoyable movie if you are a fan of Kevin James & his goofball sense of humor. **Oh yeah & as a side note, the soundtrack was full of rockin tunes as well especially with the track 'Can't Hold Back' from Survivor. I had the Greatest Hits from them for a while now & I never really noticed that track until I saw this movie & I love it now!
