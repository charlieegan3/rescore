One of the fervencies of thiz movie is on the action scene. The fight scene is something new and different, which follows later by other movies. Behind that extraordinary fight scene is well-known Martial Arts Choreographer, Yuen Woo Ping. Woo Ping is the man behind CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON(2000), KILL BILL (2003),THE FORBIDDEN KINGDOM (2008), even Jackie Chan classic action SNAKE IN THE EAGLE SHADOW (1978). His experiences in a lot of Asian movies made him effective. The movie definitely exceed beyond our imagination. In fact, many people did not understand entirely the story of THE MATRIX, there are still many blank spot to question about. The Content of the movie fills with great philosophies inside. It seemed to me Wachowski Brothers discovered successfully how to make a brilliant concept from some of religions.

Everything in this movie has occult meaning, but it's up to us, the viewers to figure out what that meaning is. This movie is like a puzzle. But this is all done in a very cool, entertaining way with awesome special effects (cutting edge at the time it was released) and great memorable action scenes, some which have greatly influenced the special effects of Hollywood movies produced afterwards. My only complaint about this movie is the way the love of Neo by Trinity is revealed, I mean you have no idea and I remember in the theater myself and everyone around me groaning since the whole love story in action films thing has been done to death and this seemed so cliche. The love between Trinity and Neo is very important to the trinity in the long run but imo it could have been introduced in a much better manner, maybe some flirting scenes leading up to it because you just don't see it coming at all which makes it really unrealistic. But other than that a great, epic movie. The Matrix (and the entire Matrix Trilogy) is like an onion, it has many layers of meaning, and every-time I watch it I notice something new.

Ja, so alt ist dieser Film schon. Wenn man Matrix in ein Film-Genre einordnen wollte, so wären wohl Action und Science Fiction die Hauptkategorien. Das allein wird dem Werk jedoch nicht gerecht. Neben minutenlangen Baller-Szenen entpuppt sich eine Wahnsinnsstory, die ins Philosophische geht. Aber erst einmal zu den Anfängen. Der Protagonist, Thomas Anderson (gespielt von Keanu Reeves), ist ein Computer-Hacker und führt ein isoliertes Leben. Doch dann wird ihm eine geheimnisvolle Botschaft von Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) auf seinem Computer gesendet. Noch unklar, was ihn erwarten wird, beschließt er, dieser Nachricht auf den Grund zu gehen. In einem Nachtclub trifft er dann eine junge Frau namens Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), die ihn zu einem Treffen mit Morpheus überreden will. Durch eine Wendung der Ereignisse wird er zur Zielscheibe eines Agententeams. Die einzigen Personen, die ihm helfen wollen, sind eben jene zwielichtigen Personen, die ihm eine \"Wahrheit\" verkaufen wollen, die er sich nicht im Entferntesten vorstellen kann. Ist die Welt real oder nur eine computergesteuerte, von Maschinen beherrschte, virtuelle Illusion? Regie und Drehbuch führen die Wachowski-Geschwister, die ebenfalls das Drehbuch für \"V wie Vendetta\" schrieben. Ihnen und der sehr guten Leistung der Schauspieler ist es zu verdanken, dass zu keinem Zeitpunkt im Film eine Handlung realitätsfremd wirkt. Neben der erstklassigen Schauspielarbeit tragen die herausragenden Spezialeffekte enorm zur Atmosphäre bei. Für ein Science Fiction Werk genial, für seine Zeit Weltklasse. Bullet-Time, eines der wesentlichsten und markantesten Effekte, feierte nach Matrix eine Revolution im Action-Genre. Jedoch ist ihre Anwendung in Matrix bisher noch unübertroffen. Farbfilter, wie sie in \"300\" oder \"Kill Bill\" bekannt sind, kommen auch bei Matrix zu Einsatz. Wie bereits erwähnt sind aber gerade die philosophisch/religiösen Elemente und Hinweise, welche im ganzen Film durch Namensgebung Handlungen und Dialogen auftauchen, besonders hervorzuheben. Versteckt unter der ganzen Action behandelt der Film die Mythen verschiedener Religionen und Weltanschauungen und wirft durchaus tiefgründige Fragen auf.

In 1977, George Lucas changed the landscape of cinematic Science Fiction forever with \"Star Wars,\" taking the genre light years ahead of all that preceded it.  Such a momentous advancement would not be seen again for over twenty years, when, in 1999, the Wachowski Brothers raised the bar again, taking the genre at warp speed  to an unprecedented level with their astoundingly innovative film, \"The Matrix.\"  Co-directed, written and produced by Larry and Andy Wachowski, it is an allegory of salvation and redemption filled with symbolism and metaphor (the Biblical references alone should keep theology students debating this one for years to come); a thinking man's action film, accentuated with moments that are no less than profound.  In a world of the future, things are literally not what they seem, where it's Man versus Machine, Reality versus Fantasy, and few who know the truth; among those who do, is Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), who has long awaited the arrival of \"The One,\" who it has been prophesied will be the salvation of the world.  Enter Neo (Keanu Reeves), a computer programmer with an innate sense of discrepancy as to the state of things around him; he has questions, most of which are still in the process of being formulated in his own mind.  (What is the Matrix).  Morpheus has answers.  And when they meet, it's Alice down the rabbit hole, and Neo's life is changed forever.  Reeves is perfectly cast as Neo, the enigmatic young man who may or may not be \"The One,\" and it's one of the best roles of his career.  He conveys a sense of removed, distracted urgency that defines his character, infusing him with both a strength and vulnerability that coalesces as the story progresses into determination and confidence.  The underplayed, subtle character development (largely unacknowledged and under appreciated) is a nice piece of work by Reeves.  As Morpheus, Fishburne is dynamic; he endows him with a quiet intensity that fairly roils beneath the surface, effectively restrained while leaving no doubt as to the character's power and purpose.  You understand his resolution completely by his countenance alone; by the way he speaks and carries himself.  It's a memorable performance by one of the truly gifted actors of our times.  (What is the Matrix).  Other notable performances include those by Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith), who brings a formidable, white-collar sinisterness to his character that is chilling; Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity), a strong, vital presence throughout the film; and Joe Pantoliano (Cypher), who is entirely convincing in his role of a Cyber-age Judas.  Rounding out the terrific supporting cast are Gloria Foster (Oracle), Marcus Chong (Tank), Julian Arahanga (Apoc), Matt Doran (Mouse), Belinda McClory (Switch) and Ray Anthony Parker (Dozer).  A visually stunning, thought provoking, captivating film, \"The matrix\" is a triumph of movie-making that assures the Wachowski's a permanent place in cinematic history.  The special effects are cutting-edge, state-of-the-art; the choreography of the action sequences is top rate and delivered with a style and effectiveness worthy of comparison to John Woo's best; and, most importantly, the story itself is complex, intelligent, and deftly takes you into regions beyond the known.  This is Science Fiction at it's best, but beyond that, it's a great movie that transcends genre or category; a landmark film that must be experienced more than once, for new meaning is gleaned with every viewing.  Enhanced by a driving soundtrack that completes the package, highlighted by incredible action,outstanding performances and memorable scenes to numerous to mention, this is a movie that absolutely must not be missed.

It's hard to  believe that such a slick, glossy production starring Keanu Reeves conveys  such deep, mind-boggling concepts, but it does.The directing Wachowski  brothers (the guys responsible for the wonderfully outrageous Bound), have  been influenced heavily by other filmmakers, authors and artists, and they  don't try to hide it in the least.  However, rather than a blatant rip-off,  this plays more like a reverent homage.Laurence Fishburne projects a  powerful presence as the wise Morpheus, although it often seems that he  employed William Shatner as his dialogue coach.  Keanu Reeves is in his  element.  The Matrix maximizes his strengths (his ability to look  completely dumbfounded and his unique physicality) and minimizes his  weaknesses (just about everything else).  The role of Neo is tailor-made  for him.  The real standout in the cast, however, is Carrie-Anne Moss as  Trinity.  She is a real find, and while she is stunning in a shiny black  cat suit, her purpose in this film is not simply ornamental.  She is  responsible for at least half of this movie's excitement, and she gives it  its emotional heart.The Matrix is two movies in one.  One is a truly  awesome action movie, and the other is a deep meditation on the nature of  reality.  It can be enjoyed equally on both levels, but maybe not on first  viewing.

Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded\nthose bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its\ngenre is that there are simply no loopholes.  The script, written by the\nWachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky.  The kung-fu\nsequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud\nof.  The photography was breathtaking.  (I bet if you had to cut every\nframe\non the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would\nstand\non its own.)  And the acting?  Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me\nan actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and\nvulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did.  But, come to\nthink\nof it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to\nconfuse that actor for bad acting.  As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply\nwicked!  Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that\naura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne.  His character, battle-scarred\nbut always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He\nloves\nNeo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the\nbottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut\nthrough this generation.  My generation.\nThe Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they\nfinished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE.  What\nis the Matrix, you ask?  Something that's closer to reality than you\nthink.Either that or it's my personal choice for best film of\nall-time.\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb",

review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do\nbecause this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film\njustice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I\nsaw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to\nmyself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever\nseen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of\nfilms that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story\nwas very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of\nthe film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having\nseen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film.\nI recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I\nwrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of\nthe philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate\nthe film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements\nbecause the film is quite literally packed with them.Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't\nany issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless.\nKeanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and\nwhile he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in\nThe Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines\nwhich was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works\nbecause this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and\nfacial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is\nvery good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's\nmentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with\na certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique\nand interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds\nin looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a\ncritically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his\ncharacter, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his\ncharacter is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't\nto spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small\nrole that will have greater significance in the following films and she\ndoes a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving,\nhowever, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to\nwatch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some\nhuman traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly\nsense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving\nwho has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded\nthe Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a\nnomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The\nreason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is\nsimply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones\nin Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been\nspoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the\nsymbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not\nunlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The\nfilm looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has\nit already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against\nnew science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and\nyou have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much\nany other film is the story and the philosophical and religious\nelements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I\ndidn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I\nthink I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the\nfilm draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus\nwith the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden\nin his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name,\nAnderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning \"man\" and combine this\nwith the second part of his last name \"son\" and add a little creativity\nyou will come up with the combination \"son of man\" which was a title\nJesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man\ncalls him (and I quote): \"You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus\nChrist.\" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the\nChristianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism,\nGnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his\nanalogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and\nSimulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on\nforever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them\nfurther.To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can\nonly give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You\nwon't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice\nwould probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect\npeople to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings:\nThe Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and\npeople who like philosophy.10/10 - on my top 3 of best films.\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"\nWriting a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do\nbecause this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film\njustice by writing a good review.", :clean_text=>"writing a review of the matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore i want to do the film justice by writing a good review", :sentiment=>{:average=>-0.465, :corrected_average=>-0.08, :scores=>[0.5, -0.28, -1.54, -0.54], :total=>-1.86, :weighted_total=>-1.86}, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"To tell the truth the first time I\nsaw the film I was enamored by the effects.", :clean_text=>"to tell the truth the first time i saw the film i was enamored by the effects", :sentiment=>{:average=>0.4475, :corrected_average=>0.45, :scores=>[0.0, 0.83, 0.585, 0.375], :total=>1.79, :weighted_total=>1.79}, :context_tags=>{:editing=>70}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>2, :text=>"I remember thinking to\nmyself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever\nseen in my life.", :clean_text=>"i remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films i had ever seen in my life", :sentiment=>{:average=>-0.07999999999999999, :corrected_average=>0.06, :scores=>[0.4, -0.42, -0.565, 0.265], :total=>-0.31999999999999995, :weighted_total=>-0.0}, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>3, :text=>"Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of\nfilms that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story\nwas very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of\nthe film very much.", :clean_text=>"also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much", :sentiment=>{:average=>0.33375, :corrected_average=>0.4, :scores=>[0.6, 0.42, -0.28, 0.595], :total=>1.335, :weighted_total=>4.005}, :context_tags=>{:plot=>100}, :emphasis=>3.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>4, :text=>"It wasn't until some time later (and after having\nseen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film.", :clean_text=>"it wasnt until some time later and after having seen the film a few times more that i started to think about the film", :sentiment=>{:average=>0.28125, :corrected_average=>0.0, :scores=>[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.125], :total=>1.125, :weighted_total=>1.125}, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>5, :text=>"I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I\nwrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of\nthe philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate\nthe film even more.", :clean_text=>"i recognized the christian elements quite quickly but it wasnt until i wrote an actual page essay on the film that i tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more", :sentiment=>{:average=>0.0, :corrected_average=>0.18, :scores=>[0.2, 0.0, -0.73, 0.53], :total=>0.0, :weighted_total=>0.0}, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>6, :text=>"I won't say that I have recognized all elements\nbecause the film is quite literally packed with them.Acting wise the film works excellently.", :clean_text=>"i wont say that i have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with themacting wise the film works excellently", :sentiment=>{:average=>0.42125, :corrected_average=>0.42, :scores=>[0.0, 0.83, 0.325, 0.53], :total=>1.685, :weighted_total=>0.0}, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>7, :text=>"I won't say that there aren't\nany issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless.", :clean_text=>"i wont say that there arent any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless", :sentiment=>{:average=>0.31, :corrected_average=>0.1, :scores=>[0.1, 0.83, 0.375, -0.065], :total=>1.24, :weighted_total=>0.0}, :context_tags=>{:cast=>100}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>8, :text=>"Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A.

The amount of emotion in The Godfather is amazing too as the you clearly feel each character's emotion and are drawn into it. The moments staying forever in your mind because it is so amazing. The Godfather reinvents the way I look at movies, my view of them has changed forever as I see how masterful this film is. It crushes every other film, no other film will ever come close to knocking The Godfather off its pedestal of greatness. Flaws, this sounds mundane but I cannot say it any other way, there are like ZERO flaws in the film. I scrutinized but could not find any at all. The good aspects deeply mask the film's bad aspects so a perfect movie has been created in a sense, that is amazing. I have not given a movie a perfect 10 out of 10, I have not seen a movie worthy of the all-time high but that changes with The Godfather and it is well deserved.

This business is told as a memorable reflection from Michael, played in perfectly calm but conflicted fashion by Al Pacino, who is the family member not quite sure what he wants, not part of the business, but suited for it. We are immediately thrust into the struggles of each crime family as they attempt to get stakes in a new market, something which Vito refuses to be a part of, put also something that almost costs him his life. With this, the eldest and hot-headed son steps forward, Sonny (James Caan) who ignores the wishes of the consigliere Tom (Robert Duvall) and seeks revenge on those who wronged his family. In the midst of all this there is a warming tone of a film, with some truly touching performances and some unforgettable turns as gangsters in 1940s New York. James Caan is well casted as the good-naturedbut short-tempered Sonny, who wants power, but also seems to want whats best for most of his family. But its Al Pacino and Marlon Brando who excel the film to remarkable achievements, Brando creates a character that simply couldn't be replicated or remade, and Pacino plays a conflicted but right-minded youngest brother, he gets what he wants and Pacino shows excellence in his eyes and confident speaking. A true journey of emotion, heartache, acceptance and love, the film explores all areas of what it means to be true to oneself, but also to forgive and forget, this is a truly remarkable feat and a masterful film that has given us some of the most memorable characters we have ever known, but also set a standard in the film industry as a force to be reckoned with, even as the years since its release tick on.", :useful=>[0.0, 0], :username=>"StevenF", :date=>"Aug  7, 2013", :location=>nil, :title=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"metacritic", :url=>"http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-godfather"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"Films like The Godfather are the reason i have a lifelong passion and love for film.", :clean_text=>"films like the godfather are the reason i have a lifelong passion and love for film", :sentiment=>{:average=>0.44749999999999995, :corrected_average=>0.29, :scores=>[0.5, 0.63, 0.335, 0.325], :total=>1.7899999999999998, :weighted_total=>0.0}, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"A combination of writing, acting, cinematography and a thoroughly engrossing plot have undoubtedly created one of the greatest pieces of cinema, point blank.

It's a great story, with a superstar cast, which set the genre for all the mafia films that followed, but that in and of itself means the film is going to have problems. As with other mafia films, it's difficult to keep track of who's who in the large cast. It also moves rather quickly and viewers like myself are going to have a very difficult time of trying to follow the erratic timeline of the film. Some parts move at a snails pace, while other just fly by, and what is with the music? The soundtrack is almost as acclaimed as the film, but honestly if I had to hear that song one more time, during this three hour epic, I may have gone out and killed someone myself. For those unfamiliar with the story, it follows the evolution of the Corleone family, as they transition from one leader to the next. The story is fantastic and is the furthest thing from predictable that you will ever find. It is filed with classic scenes and renowned performance from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, but I really have a hard time calling such a complicated story with that much violence, the best of all-time. The Godfather is a terrific movie, and I'm glad that I finally got to see it, but in a word, the film is overrated.", :useful=>[0.0, 0], :username=>"Tss5078", :date=>"Jun 23, 2014", :location=>nil, :title=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"metacritic", :url=>"http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-godfather"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"I'd never seen the Godfather prior to this weekend.

Alliances are formed in secret, murders are plotted, enemies are butchered or blown to pieces without remorse.Inspired by the Five Families of New York City, The Godfather tells the story of how the Corleones are pushed against the wall by their rivals and other upcoming gangsters who want to make money by sources Don Vito deems beneath him, and their retaliation and its consequences. Alliances are formed in secret, murders are plotted, enemies are butchered or blown to pieces without remorse. Don Vito (Marlon Brando) and his sons Sonny (James Caan) and Michael (Al Pacino) are the main characters. The actors bringing them to life have succeeded in their jobs so supremely that these characters have become the stuff of legend. Don Vito's backstory from the novel was pushed into The Godfather Part II, and that was a practical decision as the movie was already three hours long. Sonny and Michael display their acumen for running criminal activities when the reins are handed to them in their turn. Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is the consigliere, or the most trusted adviser, of the Don. We are transported from 1940s NYC ripe with Mafia bosses one-upping each other, to Sicily and Las Vegas. The characters are never shown to traverse great expanses of land or sea in search of destiny or whatever. Neither are they shown to be engaging in life-or-death situations where they have to come out on top using their wits or physical strength or endurance. But the change of settings does meet the requirements of the epic genre. Even though we don't get to see large scale gunfights or something like that, the fact that the Corleones are in all these places helps to form that opinion. The story is essentially about a single family, and you get the impression that the message here is that family is important, and that the lengths you're willing to go to to protect them knows no bounds. The Corleones' peace is fazed when a gangster offers them a deal in drugs. Don Vito expresses his disgust and refuses. This triggers an unexpected ploy for gaining power and upper hand and turns the conflict into a fully fledged gang war. Some characters are displaced, forced to take up arms, or caught in the crossfire. Another calamity strikes when things seem to have cooled down. Finally, the Corleones deal with their enemies effectively and ruthlessly. The victory is theirs, but if it is worth it is for the audience to decide. The Godfather's success lies in its rich story and characters. Often times, great stories come about by accident. The setting complements the plot and the characters, and becoming a character itself, creates a blend that is greater than the sum of its parts. These characters and plot could quite easily have worked in a medieval setting of dynasties warring for control over a kingdom, or any other setting for that matter, but the fact that the setting was New York City and the control over the city meant control over the most lucrative criminal activities, which is a decadent scheme, and immediately paints even the good guys in a bad light, was what in my opinion made The Godfather much more intriguing and enduring. There are many enemies to deal with. The film doesn't develop them at all. The Corleones are the only ones who are explored and developed as characters. At first it seems like it is a story of a group of people who have virtually everything they could ever want and the film would only chronicle their exploits as they vanquish this enemy and that. This changes as we move forward and witness the bloodshed. No good movie can come into being without good plotting, believable characterization, classy cinematography and memorable dialogue, and here it is all brought together nigh perfectly. The production design was impressive. The houses and their interiors, and the cars and costumes were fascinating and left me with a desire to be able to witness that world firsthand. The secondary characters may not have seemed to be given much screen time to develop them but the cast is so huge that if they had done it the movie would have been at least an hour longer. The score is so simple and true to the story that you don't need me to tell you that it may be the most memorable score ever. A lot of time is spent in contemplation and silence, as the characters decide what the best course of action should be in response to a particular problem. The dialogue fleshes out the characters very well. The Godfather is essentially a film that looks into the lives of the gangsters at the top of the hierarchy. We only see the comings and goings, and not the handiwork, of the men who carry out the orders of their bosses. No shootouts during the gang war are shown. The intrigue that directly affects the main characters is in itself so destructive and deadly that not once the exclusion of the ordinary mobsters bother me in any way. The Godfather cannot be dismissed as being merely about a mob family and a bunch of criminals. Given his later career, I think it's safe to venture that Coppola was born to make this movie.", :useful=>[0.0, 0], :username=>"Swati", :date=>"Mar  6, 2014", :location=>nil, :title=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"metacritic", :url=>"http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-godfather"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"Inspired by the Five Families of New York City, The Godfather tells the story of how the Corleones are pushed against the wall by their rivals and other upcoming gangsters who want to make money by sources Don Vito deems beneath him, and their retaliation and its consequences.

Two years later, this film adaptation appeared and I have since seen it (as well as Godfather Part II) more than a dozen times. Francis Ford Coppola deserves all of the praise and awards these films have received over the years. He should also be admired for insisting that Pacino and Brando be cast in two of the major roles despite strong opposition from Paramount. Coppola assembled a superb cast but also an equally talented crew. Those who share my high regard for it no doubt have their own favorite scenes. Mine include Michael's enlistment of a bewildered young man's assistance at the hospital until members of the Corleone family arrive to protect their don, the sequence in the restaurant which results in the killing of Sollozzo and McCluskey, Tom Hagen's discussion with Jack Woltz during dinner, Michael's reunion conversation with Kay as they stroll in a New England village, and the montage of executions during the baptism. None of the extensive violence in the film seems gratuitous. Each major character is fully developed. The cinematography and score are outstanding, although neither was even nominated for an Academy Award. Dark as this film often is, it also has its lighter moments, as during the wedding celebration when Luca Brasi rehearses his remarks before presenting a gift and later when Clemenza teases Michael good-naturedly about Kay Adams. For me, the single most interesting element in the film is Michael's gradual development from his family's baby brother (albeit a war hero) to its ruthlessly efficient don. Once he volunteers to kill Sollozzo and McCluskey, his destiny is assured. In some respects, this film reminds me of an opera but one with a multi-dimensional plot as well as grandeur in its style, scope, and emotional impact.

Any doubt about that can be dispelled by watching the movie. I missed this when it first came out, and then a curious thing happened. For some reason I thought I had seen the film. One decade and then two went by and I kept hearing what a great film The Godfather was. But I was unimpressed because I thought I had seen it.I don't know what film I had seen, but it wasn't The Godfather. Seeing this film for the first time over thirty years after the fact of its production is a startling experience. The Godfather is a work of art from first scene to last. There is the most amazing adherence to that fiction which is truer than fact.I would like to say that I played cards with Mario Puzo who wrote the novel from which the film was adapted and who famously worked with Coppola on the screenplay, but in fact I only played cards with some people who had played cards with Puzo. Ah, such is the effect of celebrity. Puzo became like Coppola something of a legend after this film was produced, and everybody suddenly knew him or played cards with him. Everybody, from the most unsophisticated celluloid fan to the most erudite and jaded critic had walked out of that theater after 171 minutes mesmerized and delighted and emotionally moved by an uncompromising look at not just a Mafia family, but the psychology of families since time immemorial. The truth that we have all lived and experienced was made large on the screen in the form of the Corleones. I can guarantee you that audiences from every culture on the planet would understand the underlying psychology of this movie and take it to some serious extent as their own.Marlon Brando plays the godfather (the patriarch, of course, or even the warlord if you like) of the past and the present, and then, as must always be the case, comes a new godfather. What is fascinating is who this new godfather is and how he comes to power. The ending of the film is--after so many brilliant scenes and so many psychologically true surprises and so many excursions to Queens and the Bronx and Sicily and Las Vegas (each vignette absolutely integrated into the story of the film)--even more ponderously true and a surprise that sneaks up on us so stealthily that it is not a surprise. And when the credits begin to run after Diana Keaton's tears of realization, we too realize the \"message\" of the film. It is a message that I think would be understood in the Middle East today (and two thousand years ago as well) as I write this, a message of tribal ways and the rise and fall of warlords and the Machiavellian machinations of the prince who would be king.But it is Al Pacino's performance as the son of the godfather that in the final analysis steals the show as he goes from the intellectual boy who would be a legitimate American success at the finest colleges, etc. to a man wearing the hat of Al Capone. And Pacino makes us believe every step of the way.Well, I should not say that it Al Pacino who steals the show. In truth this is Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece. He would not have the film he has without Al Pacino or Marlon Brandon and certainly not without the novel and script from Mario Puzo, of course; but make no mistake about it. Coppola manicured every scene. He attended to every detail, from the color of the wine to the tires on the cars to the dances and the music to the villas abroad to the sleaze of Las Vegas to the perfect casting of the main characters right down to the extras including both cute and not so cute kids, as indeed life would give us. In some very real sense Coppola lived this movie and it was a part of him, and yet I am stuck by the fact that Puzo invented it.This is an American classic, an uncompromising work of art that engages, informs and moves the audience--just about any audience--to ask the great questions regarding who we are and what we should do and how we should live. From the wedding to the funeral to the christening to the priest in Latin voice-over as the final vengeance is planned to that final vengeance (that we know will NOT be the final vengeance), we are glued to our seats as the life of human beings (who could very well be us) passes before our transfixed eyes.Oscars went to Brando as best actor, and to Puzo and Coppola for best screen adaptation. In a rare show of almost universal agreement among movie goers, critics, and the Academy, The Godfather won the Oscar as Best Picture in 1972.Don't miss this as I had for so long, and see it for Coppola who can take his place among the greats of all cinema for this film alone.", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[38, 46], :date=>" 2004 November 23", :title=>"One of the best ever

greatest American film of all time.  It may not have been the slickest piece of film-making or broke any new ground but it's themes, the importance of family, both biological and professional, resonate to this day.  In this case the families happen to be both Italian-American and Mafia, but that's just incidental.  I've never read the novel that this is based on but it's my understanding that Mario Puzo's book is pulpier than than the film that Francis Ford Coppola made of it.  That is one of the reasons that this film is elevated above all others in that it could have been soapier and glitzier than it was but it did not succumb to that and credit has to be given to Coppola as both screenwriter and director for that.  Coppola emphasized in his script it's most important theme, family, and concentrated on developing characters instead of stereotypes.  Yes, some people remember the more violent and sensational aspects of this film.  We also know the people in this film.  The Corleone's are as familiar to us as either are own family or neighbors.  Marlon Brando gives an appropriately subdued performance here as Don Vito Corleone.  His character seems melancholic and rueful, seeming to be mourning his situation in life or the changing ways of his chosen way of life, yet accepts the reality and the responsibilities that come for a man in his position.  Al Pacino in his second film, his first being the little seen \"Panic in Needle Park\", is dynamic as Michael, the son that the Don wanted better things for but because of changing circumstance is drawn into the family business.  Michael is to prove that he is more than up to the challenge of settling scores.  James Caan as Sonny, the heir apparent to the Don who may be a little to emotional and hot-headed for the job, does tremendous work here.  Robert Duvall is also good in the role of Tom Hagen, adopted son of the Corleones, who acts as lawyer for the family's business.  It also should be noted that John Cazale appears here as Fredo, the ineffectual Corleone son.  Fredo's character isn't really developed until the second installment of this saga but I would like to note that Cazale, who died young in 1978 but made the most of his short life.  Besides appearing in the first two \"Godfather\" films he also appeared and was quite effective in \"The Conversation\", \"Dog Day Afternoon\", and \"The Deer Hunter\", released after his death.  There are may other great actors (Talia Shire, Richard Castellano, etc.) so numerous who do good work here.  Some would feel that \"The Godfather\" is a romanticized depiction of the Mafia but I don't see that as the case.  \"The Godfather\" is a good story whose milieu is incidentally in the world of organized crime.  On a final note, Coppola contributes an excellent and very informative commentary to the film on the DVD that enhances the viewing of the film particularly for those who've seen it numerous times.",

Then I retrieved Mario Puzo's novel from my book collection and plowed through it, savoring and relishing this extraordinary piece of literature that had such an impact on our cultural landscape thirty-plus years ago.Francis Ford Coppola's THE GODFATHER is a triumphant, magnificent screen portrayal of Puzo's epic book.  The story of an Italian-American mob \"family\" entrenched in inherent and often desperate violence, Coppola weaves this film with compelling, moving, and haunting visuals that are as beautiful as they are disturbing.  The scenes are at once simplistic and complex, yet such a dichotomy is not lost on the viewer, but embraced--appreciated for its overwhelming genius.I've seen more than my fair share of Marlon Brando films, and in my opinion the character of Don Vito Corleone is this actor's signature role.  Brando effectively portrays the Godfather's compassion, love and devotion to his family, and calm acumen to make \"business\" decisions that literally mean life or death to countless men.  Don Vito is both a family man and a killer:  two seemingly inconsistent characteristics that make Brando's portrayal even more remarkable.  The rest of the cast, including James Caan and Robert Duvall, is exceptional, but it is Al Pacino as young Michael Corleone--Don Vito's \"baby boy\" who was not meant to enter the family business--who provides the most telling role in this film.  Before our very eyes, we see Michael change from a man eager to remain at arms-length to the Corleone family ventures to a ruthless, cold-blooded Godfather himself--a transformation both astounding and eery.THE GODFATHER is a feast of unforgettable cinematic moments:  from an ambush at a toll booth to a bloody horse head wrapped in satin sheets.

TNT-6", :location=>"from nowhere", :date=>"5 March 2002", :content=>"\n\nThe Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find\nany\nsignificant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the\nacting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic\nwritten all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now\nconsidered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it\ncomes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary\nas\nCitizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a\nmovie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for\n\"gangster movies\", but its influence goes well beyond that.The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements\nof\nit can be found in virtually every \"organized crime film\" nowadays; almost\nevery comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed\nsomething in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito\nCorleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's\nimagination.But to say that The Godfather is simply \"influential\" is to diminish its\ntrue qualities, and so is to describe it simply as \"a movie about\ngangsters\". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves\naround\n(despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the\nmovie\nnever tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of\npsychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked.\nConsiderations\non how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear\ndifferent from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a\nhuman\nsoul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a\nstory that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the\nresult\nis a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to\nconsider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic\ntriumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever\nappear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in\nportraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a\nslip.\nThe exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively\nby\nMarlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan\nand Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the\nruthless\nVirgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other\nroles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us\nbelieve these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a\ncentral character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around\nhim:\nalthough Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time,\neverybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it\npossible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to\nobserve how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more\neffectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in\nthe\nlast few years.The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie\n(Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the\nuse of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his\nlife. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's\npower extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely\npopular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless\nkiller,\nDon Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him\nback. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence\nand\nintuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger\npeople\nworking in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete.\nThe Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too\ndangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up\nself-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a\nlong time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close\none\neye. Drugs are another thing.To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while\nmaintaining\nhis economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a\npowerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don\nCorleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by\nthe latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see\nMichael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take\npart in the family business, lose his \"innocence\" and transform into a\ngangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up\nagainst.I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe\nthat\nthe film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and --\nbelieve it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never\nseen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an\nincredible tension, various twists, and although like any other\nmasterpiece\nThe Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still\nbe\na phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for\nthe\nfirst time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such\ncomplicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short\nreview like this one would be inadmissible.There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel\nwritten by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an exposé\nof\ntrue facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for\ninstance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other\ncharacters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that: frankly,\nI\nhave no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra\nreference seems obviously quite believable.The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are\nused perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a\nfair\namount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is\nuniversally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances\nby\nPacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.\n\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb",

A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like\nthis film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This\nwas until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for\nthis sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read)\nevery last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I\ngrew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients\nworking in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across\nthis, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters:\nGood films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat\nbecause the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want\nmono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish\ncontrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes\nfilms deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the\nDon's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas\nSonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply\nhaving these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do\nis to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then\ndwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in.\nThe Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many\ntry to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character\nobscurities that stretch credibility.2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a\ntransformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the\nend of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's\ncharacter must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must\nalso have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the\nwedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film.\nAgain, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal\n(literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall\nStreet).3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple\nreason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was\nnot much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the\nnew goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family\nlife, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the\nkey (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with\nWolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While\nstudios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it\nif you have a ripper story to base it on.I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous\nre-watch-ability.\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"\nThis is a masterpiece.", :clean_text=>"this is a masterpiece", :sentiment=>{:average=>0.225, :corrected_average=>0.23, :scores=>[0.4, 0.0, 0.25, 0.25], :total=>0.9, :weighted_total=>0.0}, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"A timeless masterpiece.", :clean_text=>"a timeless masterpiece", :sentiment=>{:average=>0.225, :corrected_average=>0.23, :scores=>[0.4, 0.0, 0.25, 0.25], :total=>0.9, :weighted_total=>0.0}, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>2, :text=>"Initially, I didn't like\nthis film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring.", :clean_text=>"initially i didnt like this film all that much i found it rather overhyped and boring", :sentiment=>{:average=>-0.029999999999999978, :corrected_average=>0.18, :scores=>[-0.1, -0.83, 0.655, 0.155], :total=>-0.11999999999999991, :weighted_total=>-0.11999999999999991}, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>3, :text=>"This\nwas until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for\nthis sort of film: subtitles.", :clean_text=>"this was until the advent of dvd which gave me the feature i needed for this sort of film subtitles", :sentiment=>{:average=>-0.13624999999999998, :corrected_average=>-0.2, :scores=>[0.0, -0.42, -0.375, 0.25], :total=>-0.5449999999999999, :weighted_total=>-0.0}, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>4, :text=>"Once I switched them on and heard (read)\nevery last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I\ngrew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients\nworking in near perfect harmony.", :clean_text=>"once i switched them on and heard read every last word of brandos ramblings and other characters ramblings i grew a true appreciation for this epicto make a true epic you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony", :sentiment=>{:average=>0.94875, :corrected_average=>0.49, :scores=>[0.9, 0.83, 0.245, 1.82], :total=>3.795, :weighted_total=>3.795}, :context_tags=>{:plot=>50}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>5, :text=>"For screenwriters who come across\nthis, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters:\nGood films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat\nbecause the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want\nmono-tonal characters... aka matrix;

The first time I\nviewed 'The Godfather' I was in my early teens and it was the most\nastounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my\nall-time favourite film. It is due to this that I have been looking\nforward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So let's\nstart from the beginning. The film opens to four words, 'I believe in\nAmerica', it's crazy to think that this simple line has become a\nresonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the\nfilm's \"threshold\". This is just one of the many renowned quotes that\nlitter the film, and believe me, there are a lot. After the first take\nwe are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantly\nportrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando. Vito is a\nfeared man, he is a criminal, he is a mafioso, but above all he is a\nrespected family man, his three sons are depicted by three excellent\nactors, James Caan, John Cazale and Al Pacino as well as his adopted\nchild Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall. The film follows Vito as he\nattempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son, Michael.\nWith some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have ever\nbeen seen in the 1970's film industry (including a certain horse's\nhead), 'The Godfather' epitomises how violence can be used effectively\nwithin a film. The Corleone's are some of the greatest antiheroes to\nhave ever been seen on screen, whilst they are villains, the audience\nwill refuse to accept that fact, Coppola does something simple and\naudacious, he takes the guilt out of organised crime. A film rife with\nbeautiful cinematography, memorable musical scores and well-paced\naction and drama. Overall, The Godfather is one of Hollywood's greatest\ncritical and commercial successes that gets everything right; a\ngangster flick that is overflowing with life, rich with emotion and\nsubtle acting, and further blessed with amazing direction from Francis\nFord Coppola. Arguably the most unforgettable masterpiece to have ever\nbeen made.\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"\n'The Godfather' is the pinnacle of flawless films!", :clean_text=>"the godfather is the pinnacle of flawless films", :sentiment=>{:average=>0.01874999999999999, :corrected_average=>-0.19, :scores=>[0.0, 0.83, -0.44, -0.315], :total=>0.07499999999999996, :weighted_total=>0.0}, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"The first time I\nviewed 'The Godfather' I was in my early teens and it was the most\nastounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my\nall-time favourite film.", :clean_text=>"the first time i viewed the godfather i was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film i had ever seen and has since then stood as my alltime favourite film", :sentiment=>{:average=>0.25625, :corrected_average=>0.3, :scores=>[0.3, 0.63, -0.155, 0.25], :total=>1.025, :weighted_total=>0.0}, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>2, :text=>"It is due to this that I have been looking\nforward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic.", :clean_text=>"it is due to this that i have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic", :sentiment=>{:average=>-0.03625, :corrected_average=>0.11, :scores=>[0.0, 0.42, -0.595, 0.03], :total=>-0.145, :weighted_total=>-0.0}, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>3, :text=>"So let's\nstart from the beginning.", :clean_text=>"so lets start from the beginning", :sentiment=>{:average=>-0.08625000000000001, :corrected_average=>-0.02, :scores=>[0.0, 0.0, -0.28, -0.065], :total=>-0.34500000000000003, :weighted_total=>-0.0}, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>4, :text=>"The film opens to four words, 'I believe in\nAmerica', it's crazy to think that this simple line has become a\nresonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the\nfilm's \"threshold\".", :clean_text=>"the film opens to four words i believe in america its crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the films threshold", :sentiment=>{:average=>-0.1175, :corrected_average=>0.22, :scores=>[-0.2, 0.42, -1.345, 0.655], :total=>-0.47, :weighted_total=>-0.0}, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>5, :text=>"This is just one of the many renowned quotes that\nlitter the film, and believe me, there are a lot.

Since its release in 1972, The Godfather has accrued a legendary status; it's difficult to watch a film that is often touted as the best of all time with an open mind and no preconceptions. However, after watching The Godfather many times and reading the novel on which it was based upon, it's clearly something very special. The film is a sprawling epic that rewards the viewer with a savagely twisting, multi-faceted plot. It's a mobsters' coming of age tale that's laced with marriage, favours, family, betrayal, tragedy, violence and death.  Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is introduced on the day of his daughter's wedding, a very special day in Sicilian tradition where the father of the bride is to deny no man a special favour. The beneficiaries' utmost respect for the Don is illustrated in the opening stanza, their displays of courtesy coming in the form of personal address and greeting rituals.  The Don is a man of respect and principle, a man who puts emphasis on what's fair, denying to avenge, for example,  a father's anguish over the rape of his daughter by means of murder - 'That is not justice; your daughter's still alive'. In other circles however; the Don is not so respected. Vito Corleone is an old fashioned Don, what is referred to as a 'Moustache Pete'; he is reluctant to delve into the business of drugs, unlike the contemporaries from the rival New York crime families. The Don's refusal turns the relationship between the Corleones and many of the other families sour. It is how the ensuing violence is regarded as just 'business' that is the cold, harsh danger of the film. Its depiction of violence is visceral and often occurs when not expected. Rather quickly, the Corleone criminal empire falls apart; the next generation having to revitalise the family and reclaim their place at the top of the five families.The film is perfectly cast; the primary characters of Vito (Marlon Brando), Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Fredo (John Cazale), Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) and Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) are all expertly interpreted from Mario Puzo's magnum opus. The scores of supporting actors are also without fault; it's a true acting showcase. After reading the novel, it's remarkable how faithfully envisioned the characters are in the film, which is thanks to a combination of physicality and astute interpretation.The Godfather is a brilliant adaptation of Mario Puzo's masterfully told story; the 1969 novel was written with such an authenticity that it almost seems like non-fiction in certain passages. I think it's true that when one thinks of a gangster, they picture the omnipotent Vito Corleone sitting back in his chair, his glum face contemplating with that infinite sagacity and authority. The Godfather is a true spectacle in both mediums; deciding which is best is a difficult task. The only aspect that I felt was stronger in the book was character development. The character of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is given greater depth in the novel; Michael's transcendence seeming comparatively abrupt in the celluloid interpretation. The character of Luca Brasi is abundantly more powerful in the book, whom whilst is an ally of the Corleone family, is penned as an ominous nemesis with a dark, brutal secret. The film, meanwhile, essentially depicts Brasi as an oaf; he is a far less intimidating figure. Additionally, many of the supporting characters are also given interesting back stories by Puzo, notably Captain McCluskey. Of course, that level of intricacy is possible in a novel, while a film could easily become bloated with such detailing. Ultimately, 'The Godfather' is a film made by a highly talented crew who combined the seminal prose of a skilled author with brilliant direction, perfect performances, effective cinematography and the utterly beautiful, distinctive music of Nino Rota and Carlo Savina to produce one of the best, well rounded and moving films ever made. It is a film that is wholly deserving of the term 'required viewing'.", :title=>nil, :location=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"rotten_tomatoes", :url=>"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/godfather/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"It's hard to judge a film like 'The Godfather', especially for someone of my generation.", :clean_text=>"its hard to judge a film like the godfather especially for someone of my generation", :sentiment=>{:average=>-0.17375, :corrected_average=>-0.2, :scores=>[0.1, -0.42, -0.375, 0.0], :total=>-0.695, :weighted_total=>-0.0}, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"Since its release in 1972, The Godfather has accrued a legendary status;

Based on Puzo's original bestselling novel (and also co-authoring the screenplay), The Godfather tells the story of the Corleones, a mob family whose lives are put on display. A predecessor to all crime dramas that came after it, The Godfather has stood the test of time and is as fresh and entertaining as it was in 1972 because it's not so much about the crime, but rather it's about family. Willis Gordon wastes no energy in creating a color palette that's realistic, yet cinematic in scope.

{:username=>"Zach B", :useful=>"Super Reviewer", :date=>"August 1, 2011", :rating=>5, :percentage=>100.0, :content=>"In cinema, there are few films that can, at all, be considered either great, and fewer that can be considered perfect. Mario Puzoâ(TM)s The Godfather is one of those films that is perfect. Being based of off the best seller by Mario Puzo, director Francis Ford Coppola creates one of the most accurate portrayals of an Italian crime family. When most people think about films that deal with the Mafia, Italian gangsters, what they think about is people that ship drugs, deal with prostitution, and above all else, just fight others for the hell of it. But, what makes The Godfather so different is that, contrary to the rather dark, violent nature of the film, this movie destroys all stereo types as it becomes a film that is not, at all, about running a crime family. This film is REALLY about a father trying to pass his legacy and empire to one of his sons and that one son having to come to terms with his own legacy and the choices he makes. When Mario Puzo decided to originally write the novel that this film is based on, he did it only for the money and nothing else. But what he did not expect was to have his entire creation take a complete life of itâ(TM)s own in a way that only few people can imagine. Even more so was the shock of how well this film did. Want a little taste of how well this film did? Before the film was even released, The Godfather Part II was already in development. But, more on that later. Now, my complete reaction to watching this film. To say that this is one of my personal favorite films of all time would be something of a drastic understatement. With me, there are some films that you like and some that change your life. This is one of those films that changes your life with each and every viewing. When I first sat down and watched this film, I remember feeling complete once the credits started to role. I know that sounds cheap, but it is true. Everything from the story to they way â~Donâ(TM) Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is in this film, it just spoke to me in a way that very few films can ever do. And I am not the only one that felt this way. There is a magic in this movie that can never be paralleled and the closes that we get (and one that is pretty damn close at that) is the sequel that is said to be equal to better then this film. But more on that later. Letâ(TM)s get down to the details. With direction, Coppola does wonders. He keeps the story moving, never dragging behind, and keeps making you interested with the look of the film. While some have complained about the lighting used as being too dark of a film or too gold, I say that the use of that is, quite fantastic. The reason why is because it always sets the mood for the scene and the tone that you will end up feeling. Plus, little added in items like the use of oranges in some scenes give this film a little kick by letting the audience know that something is about to go down. For the direction, Coppola, you do wonders. And the Academy Award for Best Direction was well won and deserved. Now the acting. Oh, my God. What can I say? Well, letâ(TM)s think. Marlon Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor and Al Pacino won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Need I say more? Okay, I will talk about the supporting cast. With huge names like Richard Dreyfus, James Caan, Abe Vigoda, and Diane Keaton, this film is filled with some of the greatest talent that money can buy. But what shocks me the most is that they treat this film with such a tone of seriousness that they literally stop becoming themselves and become these incredible people. Next the score. Like so many classic films, this filmâ(TM)s score is something of a staple in film history. Mostly due to the famous â~The Godfather Waltzâ(TM), Nina Rota became a household name in the music world due to the simplicity of that piece. It was simple, yet set the tone perfectly. The only crime that has ever been done on this film was the score not being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score. Oh well. Later on, this film saga will get itâ(TM)s award. Finally the script. Being adapted from the novel by Mario Puzo, and being written by him and Coppola, this film mirrors the novel so closely that you would only have to read the novel to know more about the extra characters that are not THAT huge. The dialogue is authentic, honest, and bold as this well written script is presented. The Academy Award for Best adapted Screen play was also well deserved. Overall, this entire film is worthy of the magnitude that it has gotten, the awards it has won (including Best Film), and the hearts and souls it has touched. Easily one of the greatest films ever made.", :title=>nil, :location=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"rotten_tomatoes", :url=>"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/godfather/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0,

His youngest son Micheal Corleone is the youngest boy of the family and is a returning war hero with a beautiful woman who never entered the family business.
