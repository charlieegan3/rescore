More gore, though not significantly more.- More McClane-isms.  When John is driving the police car in the tunnel  towards the helicopter, Rand shoots the engine, which lights on fire.  McClane quips, \"Well the car's on fire, that can't be good.\"- When Matt runs to his side after McClane destroys the helicopter,  McClane adds, \"100,000 people are killed every year by cars.  What's  another 4?\"- Quick shot of dead guards in power plant.- When Mai dies in the elevator explosion, McClane screams a profanity  laced tirade at her.- McClane flying (and landing!) helicopter scene much longer.- The guy getting crushed in the giant blades scene doesn't have much  more blood.- Yippee-kay-yay mf-er is said in full!", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[231, 248], :date=>" 2007 November 8", :title=>"The unrated version is fantastic!

Justin Long's character shakily asks his savior if he's done stuff like that before and if he's killed someone before, to which John McClane's laconic response is \"Not for a long time.\" And, indeed, it's been 12 long years since DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE. John McClane is now older, balder, grumpier, and, saddled with a PG-13 rating, not as profane, but he still cannot stay out of trouble. This time, he's assigned the seemingly mundane task of escorting in young hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long), who's wanted for questioning. But the situation quickly sours as, within moments of meeting Farrell, McClane begins to hear that oh-so-familiar melody of automatic gunfire directed at their noggins.Both McClane and the frail but side-of-the-mouth funny computer geek speedily realize that Farrell's fringe involvement is merely the very tip of the iceberg, and that the stakes are much, much higher. Turns out that the contractor who'd hired Farrell to do a simple, innocuous code work is scheming to hold the entire nation hostage with his own paralyzing brand of cyber terrorism. Soon, the systematical shutdown of the American infrastructure is underway as, basically, all things computerized become compromised. This includes the targeting and usurping of key establishments such as the FAA, Amtrak, the stock market, and our satellite communications system. But, for Los Angelinos like myself, the most insiduous act commited may have been the subversing of *gasp* the street traffic lights.For the now grizzled John McClane, nothing much has changed. He's a Lieutenant Detective now, so he's kind of moved up in the world. And he still has those perpetually pursed lips. But his personal life is predictably very much of a mess. He's alone again, divorced (with his ex-wife Holly gone back to using her Gennero surname) and estranged from his children. The start of the film has McClane pathetically attempting to keep tabs on his wilful and sullen daughter, Lucy Gennero (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). But she wants none of his reconciliatory gestures. Not to mention, McClane's an anachronistic type who clings to classic rock music and who is computer unsavvy. Good thing he's got a hacker in his custody.It's such a treat to watch Bruce Willis again be in his element and playing this iconic role. Not that Entertainment Weekly has the final say, but I do agree with the magazine's listed assessment of Die Hard (Widescreen Edition) as being the top action film ever (ALIENS was number 2, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was number 3). Nowadays, Willis, at 52 years old, is not as spry or free with the smirks. But his physicality, even at this stage, can't be questioned as he suffered bruises and scars in the making of this film. As McClane, he still trounces bad guys with the best of 'em. But, more so than McClane's penchant for arse whoopin', what draws the audience to him is that aura of reluctance, world weariness, and doggedness which he exudes so naturally. We relate to this ordinary, blue collar cat who, time and again, becomes stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time and is forced to angrily muddle thru because there's no one else to do the job. Although LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD portrays McClane as more of a supercop this time, who can go one on one with an F-35 fighter jet and murder an assault chopper with a car, I still fondly remember the first film, in which McClane passed muster as a very likable everyday guy barely keeping it together in Nakatomi Plaza. John McClane has built up so much good will that I'm able to easily forgive - and even celebrate - the high octane and wildly improbable excesses here.Justin Long, dubiously best known as the Mac guy in the Apple computer ad campaigns, gets his number called for sidekick duties, and he does a good job, although there were times where his trembly act got to be too much. His Matt Farrell may be a borderline computer felon but his heart's in the right place. Long gets to make the brunt of the wisecracks while McClane tersely motors along (he says to some fellow geeks who'd just blown his cover, \"Good luck at the Bad Timing Awards.\"). One failing of the film is the lack of a charismatic villain. Timothy Olyphant is unmemorable as former Homeland Security computer whiz Thomas Gabriel, whose mission is to digitally teach the nation and his ex-bosses a lesson while garnering sinful financial amounts. There's nothing fresh or arresting about Olyphant's acting performance, which basically consists of a whole lot of staring really hard. But, admittedly, it's fun to witness Gabriel's ever growing exasperation as McClane persists in surviving. Maggie Q does better as the evil hot Asian babe who's also a formidable martial artist. Her character Mai proves to be pretty resilient (but, ultimately, not resilient enough). Writer and maverick director Kevin Smith gets a chance to mug for the camera as the Warlock (or Freddy, to his mom), a jedi hacker whose base of operations is in his mother's basement. Bonnie Bedelia, by the way, is sorely missed, and the film would've benefited with more scenes between McClain and his surly daughter.LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is primed to be a colossal summer blockbuster, and, as such, it has certain criteria it has to meet. Director Len Wiseman (the UNDERWORLD films) comes strong and full bore with great visuals, a relentless pace, implausible action sequences, and crazy pyrotechnics. And all this performed at raucous, senses shattering decibels. The stunts are mindblowing, keeping in mind that CG effects were kept to a minimum. These are flesh and bone stunts being done here. But, still, at the heart of the loud thrill-a-minutes, there is Bruce Willis keeping it all together with his signature McClane-isms. I still get a vast kick out of his un-PC chortling whenever he causes yet another bad guy's demise (oh, that poor, agile-as-a-monkey French dude). As always, to me, his mockery of death, in a way, adds a layer of realism as this has become McClane's way of ackowledging his vulnerability and celebrating his surviving yet another harrowing scrape. LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is PG-13, but the film finds ways to circumvent the rating as the ever resourceful McClane continues to cuss (but minus the \"F\" word) and ad-lib his way to amassing an impressive body count.

my biggest fear was that this would just be another modern actioner with John McClane in it, but not a DH movie per-se. Well, thankfully, those fears couldn't have been more unfounded. This is definitely a DH movie, and what's more is it's the best action movie I've seen in a long time (which any DH movie worth making should be). Bruce Willis is truly the greatest action hero pretty much ever, and he reminded me of that constantly during this film. Now, some of the action is silly to say the least (the F-25 jet versus truck scene instantly comes to mind), but the movie never takes itself too seriously, and everything is well staged and executed. The PG-13 rating makes little difference, and I honestly can't believe they got away with it cuz this is one hard-hitting action thriller. Trust me, nice and violent even by DH standards. Also,I honestly wouldn't have minded a little more of McClane's signature overuse of the F-bomb, but there are some great lines and it's not exactly profanity-lite. Either way, this is a true summer movie and a true Die Hard movie!

{:content=>"It is worth noting that before \"Live Free or Die Hard\" was released, it actually had two complaints that it had to deal with: not only was it PG-13, the grandfather of the \"Die Hard\" series, John McTiernan (who directed \"Die Hard\" and \"Die Hard With a Vengeance\"; something that gave McTiernan the honor of directing all but one of the DH films before this was released), was MIA. Negative signs for a sequel, especially a sequel to a film that came out twelve years ago (\"Die Hard With a Vengeance\") and is a fourth film in a trilogy.But, none of the above hurts \"Live Free or Die Hard\" whatsoever. This time around, John McClane (Bruce Willis) is still a New York City police officer. While John McClane's police work has become easier, his personal life hasn't. This is due to the fact that John McClane is divorced from his wife Holly, and that his two children, Lucy (portrayed by Mary Elizabeth Winstead in this film) and John Jr. are not speaking to him (throughout this film, with the exception of a picture of the actress that played Holly McClane in \"Die Hard\" and \"Die Hard 2: Die Harder\", Bonnie Bedelia, being present, there is no sign of either Holly McClane or John McClane Jr. throughout this film).And then, one night, everything in John McClane's life turns around and makes a turn for the worse. Once John McClane has arrested a computer hacker by the name of Matt Farrell (Justin Long), before McClane knows it, he and Farrell are on the run. Now, not only is it up to John McClane to save the life of Matt Farrell(and before he knows it, his own daughter),he and Farell,before they know it, are up against Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olymphant),a dangerous man who has the computer infrastructure and the world at the tip of his fingers.Can John McClane not only defeat Thomas Gabriel, but at the same time, rescue his own daughter, Matt Farrell, and the entire nation? Or, will the power of Thomas Gabriel lead to Gabriel defeating both John McClane and the nation, and McClane's personal life and career being permanently scarred?The only things that will tell are time, decisions, and intelligence.So, what makes \"Live Free or Die Hard\" a strong addition to the \"Die Hard\" series? Based off of the article \"A Farewell to Arms\" by John Carlin,\"Live Free or Die Hard\" understands its limits. It avoids becoming too much of reality that several people fear every day, without trying to be light for that specific reason. In that matter, \"Live Free or Die Hard\" is straightforward and realistic, something that any type of film like itself needs. There is plenty of suspense and action in \"Live Free or Die Hard\" that is richly executed, and is able to remain true to its predecessors (\"Die Hard\",\" Die Hard 2:Die Harder\", and \"Die Hard With a Vengeance\"),without recycling them. At the same time, you will find classic humor that is to be found in \"Live Free or Die Hard\". This humor 1)never fails to entertain,2)fits in well the script, and 3)is suitable enough for \"Live Free or Die Hard\" to be a strong addition to the \"Die Hard\" films, without going overboard.The acting in \"Live Free or Die Hard\" is also another one of the film's highlights. The main actors of \"Live Free or Die Hard\"--Bruce Willis,Justin Long,Timothy Olymphant,and actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead--plus several others--perfectly understand the drama and emotion that their performance in \"Live Free or Die Hard\" requires, and execute it to their fullest. At the same time, Bruce Willis and Justin Long make a perfect onscreen team, while Willis, despite his age, NAILS the action that his fourth portrayal of John McClane requires.It is also worth noting that even though some people were angry/disappointed that John McTiernan did not direct \"Live Free or Die Hard\", the director of LFODH, Len Wiseman (who was hired as a replacement director for McTiernan, as a result of McTiernan having \"Three Kings\" and \"Batman Begins\" producer Charles Roven wiretapped and lying to FBI agents about it) serves as a perfect director for the film. Not only does Len Wiseman's direction of \"Live Free or Die Hard\" save the film from its PG-13 rating (in other words, Wiseman did a good job at making sure that LFORDH was not less intense by its rating, something that could have happened) and give it the suspense, emotion, action, and humor that it needed, there is something else worth noting. That is the fact that as good as the first three \"Die Hard\" films were, all three of them did have some goofs and a few bits of inaccurate information. But,\" Live Free or Die Hard\" does not have these two flaws--something that proves that Len Wiseman did his homework while making this film, something that makes Wiseman a talented director.Bottom Line: if you are a fan of the \"Die Hard\" series, \"Live Free or Die Hard\" is not to be missed, as it is top notch and does not disappoint.", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[10, 11], :date=>" 2007 June 28", :title=>"A strong addition to the \"Die Hard\" films", :location=>"(Indiana, USA)", :username=>"Some Gravity", :source=>{:vendor=>"amazon", :url=>"http://www.amazon.com/Live-Free-Hard-Unrated-Edition/product-reviews/B000VNMMR0"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"It is worth noting that before \"Live Free or Die Hard\" was released, it actually had two complaints that it had to deal with: not only was it PG-13, the grandfather of the \"Die Hard\" series, John McTiernan (who directed \"Die Hard\" and \"Die Hard With a Vengeance\"; something that gave McTiernan the honor of directing all but one of the DH films before this was released), was MIA.

There is just something about the character of John McClane that attracts movie goers. Is it his spunky attitude or is it the fact that he is known for having really bad days? It's both. There have been action franchises that have run out of steam in the past, but all three Die Hard films were great fun. Usually I'm not a fan of dipping into the well one too many times, but if Batman Begins and Casino Royale were able to re-spark the magic then why not give Die Hard another go?Live Free Or Die Hard takes an old fashioned cop and throws him out of his element, which leaves room for a supporting character. Justin Long steps in as McClane's frazzled and tech wizard sidekick. Timothy Olyphant plays a cyber terrorist who decides to shutdown the entire nation in order to systematically collect hundreds of millions of bank account numbers in order to show the government that the system can in fact be broken. Now it's up to John McClane and his sidekick Matthew Farrell to save the day.What follows is high octane action that one expects from a Die Hard movie. An important thing to point out is how director Len Wiseman stayed true to the Die Hard style and kept CGI to a minimum. Die Hard movies were great because they did action using real stunts and real explosions. The one thing I was afraid of was that this new Die Hard would go with the trend and use CGI as a crutch when in fact it used it as a tool. There are plenty of stunts that are real sets and real explosions. A few scenes fallback on CGI, but only because doing them for real just wouldn't work. Bruce Willis also keeps the spunk that is John McClane. You'll laugh at the one-liners and the witty remarks that Willis adds in the tensest situations and of course Justin Long is just great with sarcasm. They make a great on-screen duo. I also think that the humor in the Die Hard series is what makes it such a great action series. It's the fact that the filmmakers realize they are making an action movie; a movie in which nothing could ever happen in real life. Lots of action movies take themselves too seriously and they become laughably bad, but Live Free Or Die Hard keeps that spunk that makes it laughably enjoyable. Don't get me wrong though; there are some amazing action scenes that will make you tense up. This is by no means a comedy. The elevator shaft scene was one that stood out and reminded me of the trailer hanging off the cliff in Spielberg's The Lost World.Moving onto the score this brings up Marco Beltrami. I can state here that I am not a Marco Beltrami fan. The only score of his that I liked was his score to The Three Burials Of Melquiades Estrada. I always feel like he never does anything thematic at all and which is why I was worried when he was selected to fill Michael Kamen's shoes. Michael Kamen was the composer of the first three Die Hard films, but sadly he passed away in 2003. He was a greatly respected composer and his work on the first three Die Hards were iconic. Thankfully Marco Beltrami rose to the occasion and did a wonderful tribute with his score to Live Free Or Die Hard. He touches on some themes that Kamen wrote and gives it that Die Hard feel and atmosphere.Overall this movie was great. I had a great time watching it and felt like it was better than most of the high budget stuff I've seen this summer so far.

It belongs to the wannabe action hero inside every red-blooded American male.  And to the women who love them.  Any misapprehension that these films are going to take themselves realistically or seriously should be checked at the door.LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD opened Wednesday of this week just in time for the Fourth of July celebration, and to take advantage of the extra-long weekend at the box office. It's the fourth film in the franchise about New York Police Department Detective John McClane, absolutely the toughest cop Hollywood has ever created. In my opinion. Nobody bleeds like McClane bleeds. Or limps. Or talks to himself, delivering a humorous, self-deprecating monologue on how he got into the whole mess he is in.There was some hesitation about whether or not Bruce Willis could pull off the franchise character again. There was no hesitation about the fact that if Bruce Willis could not play McClane, no one else could. Willis the actor and McClane the character are too tightly-knit to allow to anyone else to intrude into the franchise. Maybe other actors can play James Bond and win over a whole new audience, but I can't see that happening with this one. Not as long as Bruce Willis can still walk and talk.After seeing the movie, there's no doubt that Willis - and McClane -are back in a big way. For a while, Willis swore he'd never play the character again. He wanted more serious roles and a chance to stretch as an actor. He's made some good films, and some not so good films, since DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE with Samuel L. Jackson. And while the McClane role is somewhat limiting Willis pulls it off with zest. Maybe he was born to do other things as well, but he was definitely born to be John McClane.Now all the fans are going to be waiting for the next Die Hard movie, although there hasn't been any talk of such. We can only hope.The movie starts out with a bang, the way these things always do. A group of cyber-criminals utilize code and algorithms written by blackboard computer hackers to get into key Federal government installations, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation. They're operating under a man named Thomas Gabriel, who has used enough players in his operation that none of the computer hackers know who they are working for or what they are truly doing.As soon as Gabriel is certain that he's into the computer networks he wants to be into, he gives orders to start the elimination process of all the computer hackers involved. The action turns violent and bloody. Matt Farrell (played brilliantly by Justin Long) is the only one who escapes his fate, and that's only through the direct intervention of McClane.It's been twelve years since the last DIE HARD movie. Those twelve years are reflected in the latest release. McClane has gotten older and his life has moved on. His wife finally left him for good and he's estranged from his son and daughter. He's introduced breaking up his daughter's latest date in a fairly humorous scene.One of the things that was awkwardly handled in the movie was Lucy's - McClane's daughter -sudden change in feelings about her father. Viewers knew it was coming, but it came without true motivation from within. That part felt particularly scripted.When McClane gets the call to go pick up a known computer hacker, the tension immediately ratchets up. In a move that was also very scripted, McClane arrives at Matt's house just in time to keep him from being blown to smithereens. (And you have to wonder why the bad guys simply didn't walk into each of the hackers' houses/apartments and simply shoot them when they were done with them.  The explosions were just to give the special effects crew a warm-up for the action that was coming.)The cat and mouse game begins, with McClane alternately fighting to stay alive and chasing the bad guys. The action sequences are pure dynamite, fueled by adrenaline and testosterone - on part of the characters and the audience. Viewers that are totally into the McClane experience are hard pressed not to hoot and holler in support of their hero's actions and one-liners.Those fans understand that there are glaring plot holes and things that make no sense and in the real world things wouldn't function the way they do in the movie. For instance, the cell phone systems would go down almost immediately as emergency services took them over to use for their own operations. McClane uses a cell phone a lot in the beginning of the movie, as do the terrorists. Those would be the first things shut down. Security on major important network sites, like the eastern seaboard utility control area, would be immediately entrenched in military personnel if the United States government believed it was under attack.But that's beside the point. This film is about action, not about reality. Reality would be much slower paced.As always, McClane ends up being the guy involved in the investigation who gets all the key pieces as to what's really going on. It wouldn't be a DIE HARD movie if he didn't.The concept of the \"fire sale\" in the realms of cyber-terrorism is a real thing. There are a lot of checks and balances to keep it at bay, but it is one of the things the United States government constantly guards against. The movie sells the idea very well.Also, though the franchise isn't known for being cutting-edge or high-tech, there's a lot of the emerging computer technology and integrated systems that are nationwide and international in the film. Justin Long's character introduces all that technology and the concepts behind it in bite-sized chunks that the audience can keep track of in the midst of car chases, gunfights, and serious explosions.I found myself as enthralled by the computer attacks as I was by McClane's usual physical action and banter. There was something so inherently cool about watching the terror-geeks and Matt Ferrell at work on computer systems even though much of it was fake. The idea that it was all possible and would be done in such a way was amazing.But the action - that's the key to every Die Hard film. There's plenty of it in this movie. Is it over the top? No doubt about it! No one - but no one - could walk away from all the damage that McClane takes while doggedly pursuing the bad guys. I lost count of the number of bodies left behind, the number of vehicles that were destroyed in wrecks and explosions, the number of buildings that were leveled, and would have to guess that the number of bullets fired must be in the millions.The most over-the-top sequence in the film is the scene where McClane is driving an eighteen-wheeler through a system of elevated highways while being pursued and fired upon by a military attack jet with hover capability. There is simply no way this could ever happen, or that a truck could suffer that much damage and still keep going. Much less without the driver getting killed.If they do a video game on this movie as they have some of the movies in the past, you can see this sequence being part of the game. It's ludicrous.  It's impossible.  And yet, it's so McClane. And that's what puts the butts in the seats, folks.Maggie Q plays possibly the most lethal lady McClane has ever had the misfortune of crossing paths with. She absolutely tears him apart for a while. And that leads to possibly the second-most over-the-top sequence in the film when the action spreads the elevator shaft. Still, if anybody was gonna do it like this, it has to be rogue cop John McClane.Make no mistake. This film isn't for posterity. This film isn't even close to Academy Award material - except maybe for special effects.What this film is, and where it succeeds so admirably, is an action film starring one of the best action heroes ever invented or portrayed, and played once more by the only actor that could do that character justice. This is superhero action without the cape and the mutant abilities. And this is a hero who's fallible yet impossible to beat.Treat yourself to a summer delight over the holidays. Buy a ticket. Invest heavily in a willing suspension of disbelief at the door. Find a good seat. And prepare to cheer on John McClane one more time as he goes up against impossible - and, admittedly, wildly improbable - odds.", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[37, 47], :date=>" 2007 July 1", :title=>"McClane's Back!

And having to\ncatch a train home from Grand Central station at a certain time, we\nboth agreed that if the movie was sub-par, we would split early to get\nhome earlier.So finally the lights go down around 9:20 and out comes Bruce Willis.\nHe respectfully apologized and then started jazzing up the audience for\nthe film. The excitement was palpable as the crowded theater whooped it\nup with Bruce shouting \"Are you ready!!!\" Well, Julie and I were, as we got swept up in the excitement and\ncheered aloud as if we were at the ball game. Even the couple next to\nus, I'd say they were about in their late sixties, dressed very\n'proper', were just as energized. The movie starts and a mere few minutes in, the action explodes. By\ntwenty minutes into the film, Julie and I were sold. Who cares what\ntime we're gonna get home!? I have not had this much fun at the movies since I can't remember when.\nI have always loved summer movies, but only the ones that deliver the\ngoods. The action sequences are top shelf, 21st century movie making\nbrilliance. These explosive scenes are a seamless composite of\nfantastic, real world stunt work, and exceptional CGI. Hands down, they\nmake the film. And for an action movie with 'die hard' in the title,\nI'd say that was the point.It was awesome watching this film with so many people because it was\nlike riding a gigantic roller coaster, with everybody having a shared,\nhair raising experience. People were cheering like when Luke blew up\nthe Death Star. The humor throughout was just right. By the end of the\nfilm, our senses were stunned as we dizzily made our way out of the\ntheater, thoroughly entertained.Excellent summer movie!

The third one works because you have a bad guy that is out for\nrevenge against John McClane. The fourth one though, it just felt like\nMcClane's character was dropped in as an after thought. I don't think\nyou can just drop John McClane into any story and call it Die Hard and\nthis movie felt more like a Tom Clancy political thriller than a Die\nHard movie.While watching this I at least thought I would let it pass as a generic\naction movie, because I was having fun. However, then I started\nthinking about it and I'm sorry I need even my action movies to at\nleast make a little bit of sense. There was just too much stuff in this\none that didn't work for me. The first problem I had was that the bad\nguys created a giant traffic jam in DC causing congestion everywhere춘\nexcept of course for the streets they need for the major car chase\nscene. Also during the part of that car chase that took place in the\ntunnel, how come when the bad guy started turning the lights off in the\ntunnel not a single person though to turn their head lights on? However\nthe biggest action scene that bugged me was the scene where John\nMcClane is driving the big rig truck and being chased by the fighter\nplane. This scene was so laughably over the top that it had no place in\na Die Hard movie. I know Die Hard movies are known for their over the\ntop action at some points but I just could not stop laughing at how\ncompletely ridiculous this scene was. Oh and seriously, since when does\nthe 695 beltway around Baltimore have palm trees? OK, that is a bit too\nnitpicky, but it was kind of funny.The film seemed to me to also be extremely inconsistent about whether\nor not cell phones were working. The cell phones weren't working, so he\nreprogrammed the phone to use the old \"satcomm\" satellites instead.\nThen that stopped working and then a little bit later that is working\nagain. Also I'm still amazed at how Kevin Smith's character is still\nable to hack into so much stuff even after all the power on the entire\neastern seaboard has been shut off. I mean seriously there are a lot of\nservers out there that have battery backups and stuff, but a lot of the\nservers he would need to go through to have a good enough connection to\ndo any of the hacking he was doing would have been shut down after the\npower outage. OK, maybe I am picking at too much of the film, but all\nthis bugged me while watching the film and I wasn't able to just sit\nback and get sucked in like I would in any other Die Hard film.The acting in the film for the most part was pretty good, except of\ncourse for the main bad guy. He had one facial expression for the\nentire movie and the tone of his voice never changed. His only way of\nshowing anger was to throw something off his desk. His performance was\nso wooden; it just paled in comparison to Alan Rickman, William Sadler\nand Jeremy Irons, who all three just played wonderful bad guys.The look and feel of the movie didn't feel at all like a Die Hard movie\nto me either. Sure, John McClane takes a good beating like he does in\nall the films but all the action seemed to crisp and clean. It didn't\nfeel nearly as gritty as the previous Die Hard films. Also one of the\nthings I noticed was the film seemed to have this predominantly blue\ncolor scheme going on. It just felt like there was this blue hue\nthrough out the film, where in the previous Die Hard films the\npredominant colors are very earthy and red. I don't know if anyone else\neven knows what I am talking about, but that is just something that I\nnoticed that took away from the gritty Die Hard feeling.\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb",

Let me start by\nsaying the first problem was the rating. Turning a series of R rated\ngory action flicks into A PG-13 imitation does not work. It was as if\nFox was trying to pass it off as some type of family friendly movie.\nThis resulted in the film being minimal in bloody action violence,\nminimal in language use, and the use of McClane's staple line - \"Yippee\nKi Yay Mo ******\" was made to be slightly distorted so the last word\n(all Die Hard fans know what it is) was more implied than spoken. The\nrating also had another effect. Since the aspects listed above were\ndownplayed so much, the movie's style didn't come anywhere close to\nmatching the style of the first three. It didn't Feel like Die Hard.(This is off topic, but it reminds me of another time the same company\ntook two GREAT! R rated series - Alien - and Predator - and combined\nthem to make the PG-13 mockery we now know as AVP)I didn't like the villain. The whole movie it didn't seem like he\nhimself really did anything. He didn't really torture or shoot or even\nseverely harm McClane's daughter. He was never really a threat. It was\nalways a henchmen up until the end of the movie. (Unless you count the\nTunnel-Helicopter sequence) Which bugs me, where did all the henchmen\ncome from? In the first and third movies they were German militants,\nand the second movie they were military extremists supportive of\nGeneral Esperanza. It this movie - they were just kind of there. I\nmean, Gabriel was suppose to be a DoD government employee - and he just\npulled a crap load of henchmen out of no where. Were they terrorists?\nWow, nice background check on a government employee with links to\nterrorist organizations if they were.The use of technology was just awful. Specifically what you saw on the\ncomputer screens was unrealistic and felt like some sort of hi tech\nfairy tale to me (being a networking professional). I mean, I had no\nidea hacking was so graphical and straightforward.To close - if the characters weren't making some cheesy quip or not\ndying after smashing through multiple plains of glass and being hit\nwith SUV at one point - they most defiantly were contributing to what\nshould go down in history as a sorry day indeed for the Die Hard\nseries.My advice - pull a matrix and pretend the sequel doesn't exist.\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337978/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"\nI went to see this movie with very high hopes.", :clean_text=>"i went to see this movie with very high hopes", :sentiment=>{:average=>0.43000000000000005, :corrected_average=>0.22, :scores=>[0.2, 0.83, 0.205, 0.485], :total=>1.7200000000000002}, :context_tags=>{}, :context_indexes=>{}, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[], :emphasis=>0.2}, {:index=>1, :text=>"I loved the first three\nin the series -

:content=>"\nIndependence Day ReloadedA bit of my background. I am regular reader at IMDb for perhaps 5\nyears, but this was the first movie that forced me to get registered\nand write a review of it.*** Warning. Text below may contain spoilers *** Well, not really,\nthere is absolutely no suspense in this movie and it is entirely\npredictable right from the beginning.The movie consists of series of chases and shootouts that are not\nparticularly well choreographed. Plot is virtually nonexistent (in\nother words there are more of the holes that of the plot itself). Willis with his sidekick are dragged from location to location without\nany explanation how and why they got there. The scale of McLane's\nactions increased with each instalment (first saving the staff of a\nskyscraper, then airport, then a city and this time the whole country),\nunfortunately there are 2 issues now. First the whole premise hacking\nand controlling so many different computer systems is ridiculous,\nsecond the threat of terrorists does work at all. They are simply not\nmenacing enough. They are led by \"guy who shut down NORAD just with his laptop\", but\nwhen they shut down traffic in a big city, all they create is few car\naccidents (of the kind that can only happen when people are driving\nwith their minds shut down). Other than police department being swamped\nby citizens (what the hell are they doing there?), not much happens.\nCellphones work, it is possible to move around in a car, no real panic\nvisible, no police presence on streets. Especially response to events\nfrom both citizens and government is not depicted at all. I would like\nto know where the hell was the mighty US Army for entire duration of\nthe movie (apparently still tied down killing civilians in Iraq).There are all sorts of clich칠s you can imagine: * Computer genius, who\nis at the same time exceedingly naive at the same time, a bit paranoid,\nuttering nonsense all the time and absolutely useless (except he\nmiraculously saves the world in the end). * Another overweight computer\ngenius, who is a bit paranoid, uttering nonsense all the time and\nabsolutely useless. * Supermodel/kung-fu bitch crossover female\nterrorist * Girly main terrorist, who fails to be intimidating at all,\nhe seems he can start crying any minute (I really miss calibre of\nGrubers or Colonel Stuart). * Terrorist masterminds who personally\ninvolve themselves dirty jobs, instead of employing their minions. *\nGeneric industrial locations, which seem completely out of place. *\n1960s sci-fi meets Matrix style computer rooms (I recommend sets\ndesigner to visit real server room next time, reality may look more\nmenacing than this uneducated fantasy). * Cop chief who always seem to\nbe genuinely busy, but he really does nothing in the movie. *\nTerrorists have resources to hack stock exchanges, traffic systems and\nutilities all over U.S. But still, the only thing they can afford to\nstop a poor cop is a chopper and few not particularly well trained guys\nwith assault rifles.Cast There are really only two characters in the movie, all other\npeople appearing in the movie are just faceless bystanders (including\nmain foes) and their performance is not any better than of any random\nbystander watching making of a movie.Willis' performance is pretty generic, he tries to utter the same kind\nof one liners as in previous instalments, sadly most of the time they\nare out of place, badly timed or complete non sense. As the scale has\nbeen upgraded so is the McClane's self confidence who became true\nsuperhero with some supernatural abilities. Expect projecting speeding\ncars into helicopters, walking on a wing of a jet etc. This is in\ncontrast with previous instalments where McClane had been smart guy,\nbut still realistic police officer who happened to be at the wrong\nplace at the wrong time.Long is genuinely B movie actor. His performance is at best bearable.\nHe might be OK, mindless script does not give much space for his\ncharacter.Bottom line: No doubt it is the worst of all 4 Die Hards. I compared it\nto Independence Day it resembles a bit, but in many aspects ID is much\nbetter working. If you like mindless movies filled with explosions, but\ncan do without any coolness factor, then you can try this, everyone\nelse avoid it!disaster (0 out of 5)\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb",

delivers!", :username=>"ShiggyLucasWenger", :location=>"from United States", :date=>"4 July 2007", :content=>"\n12 years on; McClane is bald, estranged from his family and feels\nincreasingly like an anachronism. There is a strong 'post-9/11' vibe, a\nmuted color scheme and a strangely sombre tone that permeates\nproceedings. The film covers more terrain (literally) than it's\npredecessors and the action is slightly episodic as a result of\nshoehorning a series of mini-showdowns into a plot about\ncyber-terrorists and an attempt to shut down the US infrastructure.\nIt's handled more deftly and inventively than you might expect, but\nit's not an obvious marriage.The authenticity of the 'hacking' that takes place is also suspect\n(webcam becomes spy-cam in the basement of a security obsessed computer\nnerd?) and there is a horribly misjudged piece of casting in Kevin\nSmith as a stereotypical basement-dwelling, uber-hacker.(he simply\ndoesn't have the acting chops) Having said all of that, the action\nsequences are top-notch; brutal and old-school. (with a couple of nods\nto the 'new', in the form of the stoic but sizzling Maqqie Q and 'le\nparkour' madman Cyril Rafaelli, whose incredible dexterity is captured\nto dazzling effect by Wiseman and crew) The performances are mainly\nstrong, especially Bruce who immediately reminds you that you're\nwatching McClane despite the (slightly) sanitized language and\nvanishing hair. Justin Long is surprisingly engaging as McClane's\nassignment/sidekick in a role which could so easily have been\nirritating, and Olyphant, as the main bad guy, gives an intense and\ncharismatic performance full of understated humor and implied menace.\nHe makes for an interesting antagonist, reminiscent of Rickman's 'Hans\nGruber' in the original; a little less verbose, but a similarly\ncharming sociopath with a formidable, sub-zero stare. Even the\ninclusion of Mary Elizabeth Winstead as McClane's daughter, (another\nmove which, on paper, seemed destined to annoy) works well. She has\ninherited some of her fathers personality traits to frequently amusing\neffect, but the film-makers (wisely) avoid the temptation to give her\nany 'Lara Croft' type abilities in order to appease a wider\ndemographic, a move that would have potentially alienated the core\naudience - even more than the furore over the PG-13 rating.Speaking of the rating, while the film is light on blood and one\nparticular swear-word, the violence hasn't been toned down at all. If\nanything, McClane is actually more hardened and brutal than before.\nEnemies are often dispatched with an efficiency and a ruthlessness\ncommensurate with a man who's done this before. There is also a calm\nresignation in Willis' body language at times. McClane is a man who has\nfound no solace in being a hero; post-divorce and struggling to\nmaintain a relationship with his daughter, (His son is barely\nmentioned) he feels he has lost the things that matter most to him.\nThis is the single most notable change in the film. Gone is the\nwild-eyed, heavy-breathing, frantically pacing McClane of the original\nDie Hard; The man rapping on the windows, desperately trying to signal\nthe fire brigade. Willis communicates this malaise subtly and\neffectively, prompting the Justin Long character to ask at one point;\n'Why are you so calm? Have you done that kinda stuff before?' The\ndirection is astonishingly controlled and confident from the man that\nbought the world 'Underworld' (He may be one to watch after all.) and,\nfor my money, offers the best spectacle of any film this summer.There is a weight and an impact to the stunts and the fight scenes that\ncomes from using actual stunt-work; so often eschewed these days in\nfavor of scenes built entirely on disk.As mentioned, the tone is slightly subdued for a summer actioner\n(despite a good number of amusing lines and a healthy amount of\nself-awareness) which differentiates it from the others in the series.\nThere is a world-weariness amongst the chaos. A meditation on being\n'that guy' is one of the more inspired exchanges, and the greatest\ninsight into McClane's journey through the missing years. As a result,\nthe audience is not left to enjoy the sense of good triumphing over\nevil at the end without at least a little remorse about the meaning of\nit all (It reminded me of one of the great strengths of '24' in that\nregard.). As the credits roll, all may not be right with the world as\nwould be more typical of the genre, but there are other, more personal\ntriumphs to savor. This gives the film a little more depth than the\nprevious sequels, though it takes some of the edge off the 'octane\nbuzz' that the film injects you with.Nevertheless, this remains significantly the best blockbuster of the\nSummer Season. It is the first to truly deliver on all it promised (and\nprobably surpasses realistic expectations) It would require a second\nviewing to determine where it might rank in the series, but it is more\nthan worthy of the name and Die Hard remains, for my money, the\nundisputed champ amongst action franchises. I humbly request one more\ninstallment in which Bruce et al pour heart and soul into creating a\nworthy send-off and then suggest that Bruce let's McClane retire\nundefeated. He'll have earned it.\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337978/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"\n12 years on; McClane is bald, estranged from his family and

I love this flick, and I just don't get the hate some people have for it.\r\rA movie needs four things to really feel like a true Die Hard movie: Bruce Willis as John McClane, Michael Kamen's musical score, Jan DeBont's cinematography, and a memorable villain. \r\rLive Free or Die Hard has only one of those four things.\r\r...yet despite that fact, I was surprised to find that it is not only a good flick, but probably the best Die Hard movie since the first. Bruce is back in full force as McClane. Marco Beltrami did a phenomenal job of imitating Kamen's scores, even using some of the same themes and musical cues from previous films - This goes a long way toward creating the atmosphere of a Die Hard film. The cinematography seemed a little more modern and slick than previous installments, but they were very smart in avoiding a lot of the modern trends that would have really taken away from the film: Slo-mo is used very sparingly, and the more frenetic action scenes aren't all just quick-cut, shaky-cam, over-edited messes. \r\rThis leaves us with the villain situation. Timothy Olyphant is a good actor who can really steal a scene in the right role. But here he is only given a couple of really meaty moments to shine, and comparing him to classic villainous actors like Alan Rickman and Jeremy Irons is just unfair. So while he does a fine job, his character is not particularly memorable. The rest of the villains are filled out with the usual generic henchman, with the exception of a kung-fu right-hand woman and an overly-acrobatic top thug straight out of a Bond film.\r\rJustin Long has always been a fun, underrated actor in my opinion, but again I was worried he'd come across as a lame comic relief sidekick. Yes, he provides a lot of the laughs for the movie, but he is able to do it in a way that seems natural for his character, and it never seems forced. \r\rI was extremely worried going into this film and had kept my expectations down accordingly.  It's always nice to have high hopes for a film and have that film match your expectations, but to go in and be SO pleasantly surprised is a great feeling. I was grinning though half the movie just because I was so thrilled it was living up to the Die Hard name. The action is exciting and even if they went over-the-top in a couple sequences (the F-35 scene is quite far-fetched and feels like it belongs more in a True Lies movie), it never takes you out of the movie. It's just a great action flick and probably ranks second in the franchise only to the original in my opinion.", :title=>nil, :location=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"rotten_tomatoes",

Live Free Or Die Hard is a fine return to form, and is by far the best Die Hard film since the first one. Bruce Willis is back as maverick cop, John McClane, and boy does he seem determined in this fourth entry of the Die Hard franchise. John McClane hasn't felt this menacing since the first film.  Live Free Or Die Hard, is a different film from all the others, and is a bit risky considering we live in a time where we're vulnerable to terrorists. But it's just plain entertainment. Now before seeing this film, I skeptical, I did sort of enjoy the third entry, but felt it lacked something to truly make it memorable. So I had high hopes for this sequel.  So I saw the film, and I was stunned at what I saw; the film is a fine return to it's action roots, as I felt that the last two sequels had more of a humourous approach, which cheapened the films slightly. But in this fourth film, we have a few of the traditional John McClane wise cracks, but the filmmakers don't overdue it.  This is my favorite Die Hard since the first one, and I enjoy how they managed to do something totally new and refreshing with the overall plot of the franchise. In this fourth entry we have a terrorist who is played marvelously well by Timothy Olymphant who uses techno terrorism to wreak havoc on the United States. Olymphant is very surprising in the role, and he truly is menacing and convincing. I find him quite a hit and miss actor, but with this film he truly delivered one of the best performance since Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber in the first one. Live Free or Die Hard boasts an impressive cast of actors.  This is a phenomenal action film that delivers on the action, and the thrills, Everything that made the first Die Hard great is here, and more. The only difference is, this film is set in the 21st century. The threats are more realistic this time around, and who know with the techno terrorism going on in the film, maybe this will be the face oif terror in the next 50 years.

Though the field is very competitive this year in the best actor category he certainly deserves an Oscar nomination and, possibly, a win. McConaughney plays Ron Woodruff, the true story of a womanizing, dope taking electrician cowboy who was diagnosed with AIDS in 1985 and given 30 days to live. After a few rough days he accepts the diagnosis but does not accept the 30 day sentence. He takes AZT through underground channels as it is not approved by the FDA and is only available in a patient experiment. He quickly finds out how toxic it is, killing most people who are taking it, and does research finding other drugs, though illegal in the USA, are available in Mexico. Being a hustler he starts a club which costs $400 to join and gives people the drugs for free. As most people thought at that time, his friends, and the men he worked with, thought of AIDS as a 'gay disease' and quickly finds himself in fights and being ostracized. Collapsing one day he is rushed to the hospital where he shares a room with Rayon (Jared Leto) a transsexual with AIDS and enough sass to beat, and take his money, in a game of cards with Ron. When the latter starts his club and needs customers he and Rayon become partners developing a constant bickering repartee that also brings great empathy to both. There is no looking away from Jared Leto's performance, especially a scene when he visits his father, who brings across the sass he uses as a defense and the hurt he finds as a transsexual. At this point there is no reason he shouldn't get an Oscar nomination and if he wins it will be deserved just as McConaughey will have earned his. The films shows all the problems that people with AIDS faced, not only the discrimination but with the FDA and medical profession working against them. Ron travels all over the world to get the needed drugs and he is faced with all sorts of problems from the government and the Boards of hospitals. He eventually goes to court in San Francisco to fight for his right to take drugs that aren't approved in the USA for, mainly, financial reasons. Ron gets involved with a doctor, Eve Saks, played by Jennifer Garner who does a great job but really isn't necessary to/for the movie. Denis O'Hare as her boss Dr. Sevard, Griffin Dunne as an American doctor working in Mexico along with all the supporting actors give excellent support. The director, Jean-Marc Vallee, and the screenwriters Craig Borton and Melissa Wallack, in telling the story of two polar opposite men, don't hesitate in telling, and showing, how the world of AIDS was in the 1980s. Both Matthew McConaughhey and Jared Leto give full portraits of two completely different people who come together to help each other to live and wind up respecting each others role in life. \"Dallas Players Club\" is a must see film not only for the two main performances but for the history of the beginning of an illness that was discriminated against by the government, medical profession and the public and is still killing people today!", :useful=>[0.0, 1], :username=>"GreatMartin", :date=>"Nov 15, 2013", :location=>nil, :title=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"metacritic", :url=>"http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dallas-buyers-club"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"\"Dallas Buyers Club\" after 2 years and 3 other movies \"The Lincoln Lawyer\" (2011), \"Magic Mike\" and \"Mud\" (2013) elevates Matthew McConaughey from a drugged, drunk, naked at midnight bongo player to an A list actor who no longer has to prove himself.

As he struggles to stay alive, he is forced to use medication that brings him into conflict with the authorities. We follow Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) as his previously cavalier lifestyle is brought to a standstill with the knowledge of his disease. His confession of his illness to a friend has an unexpected effect when he is perceived as a homosexual, even though he clearly loathes them. He straightens up and does some research, and when he discusses this with Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), he finds that as long as a treatment is not approved by the FDA, there's no chance he can opt for it, despite its use in other parts of the world. AIDS brings him into contact with Rayon (Jared Leto). His hatred of gays resurfaces. But they are another misunderstood group of people who indulge in their feelings without bringing harm to anyone. Ron is evicted by his landlord and his walls are vandalized. Finally he gives up everything and heads after a rumour in Mexico. On his return he starts the Dallas Buyers Club, and attempts to spread medication not approved by the authorities. Somewhere along the way, he changes and looks at life differently. This development is surprising when it happens, and I applauded when he rose to the occasion instead of going down the easy path. Ron becomes a big businessman, travelling between different countries in order to circumvent law in bringing life saving drugs into his own country. His interactions with Dr. Eve (Jennifer Garner) are a source of great insight into the disease and much amusement on the side. We also get to see some of the hidden life and past of Rayon. Ron finally takes FDA to court to avail his right to his own treatment. Matthew McConaughey has perhaps delivered the most shining performance of his career. Other than weight loss, which is what most actors go for when a role requires it, apart from weight gain, he created a character who was at once a southern hippy and low life yet had a peculiarly uplifting view of life. Jared Leto plays a cross dressing gay man who finds friendship in the reluctant Ron. Together they spend what time they have trying to keep other people suffering from AIDS alive. The script succeeded in imparting useful information about the disease and its possible cures and the development of medicine designed to keep the harmful effects of the virus at bay. But it did not achieve this at the expense of entertainment. The film was comical all the way. We also get to witness the dirty side of society_ the misconceptions people have about the disease and its patients, and their unforgivable behaviour when they unload their insecurities onto the hapless victims. Also portrayed is the behaviour of straight men towards homosexuals. The production design did a remarkable job given that the budget was negligible compared to other great movies nominated for the category of Best Picture. The environment of the 1980s and 1990s Texas, including the cars and dresses, was convincing. The film succeeded in letting us glimpse into the daily life of that era as well as telling a good story with intriguing characters.

In 1996, McConaughey played Jake Tyler Brigance in Joel Schumacher땁 A Time To Kill. Hailed as the best performance of his career, it seemed like, critically, that was the closest the actor would get to any praise. In 2011, McConaughey took the lead in Brad Furman땁 The Lincoln Lawyer, a by-the-number crime/mystery, where, McConaughey was able to flex some of his acting muscles as opposed to abdomen muscles. Since then, in what has been the most sudden and misunderstood acting turn in recent memory, McConaughey has reinvented his career and is continuing to be casted as a serious actor with serious acting skills. While the Texan acting inspiration has remolded his career in a time span that puts to shame that of Downey Jr. and Travolta, one of McConaughey땁 unflinching signature acting staples is his bold and proud Texan accent. And while I can뗪 really imagine how a cowboy like himself was cast in Christopher Nolan땁 upcoming science fiction Interstellar, McConaughey and his accent were surely a match made in heaven for his role as the slowly weathering and dying HIV/AIDS patient Ron Woodruff. For Dallas Buyers Club, McConaughey and his accent worked exceptionally well. Quebecois director Jean-Marc Vallee helms McConaughey as Ron Woodruff; a rugged, homophobic, ultra-macho, bull-riding, money throwing, playboy with no accord to anyone. Woodruff, a money hustling, chance taking electrician juggles his fortune, his luck, his women, and his job to make ends meet and live a somewhat fulfilling life. It isn뗪 until an unexpected accident at work that leaves Woodruff hospitalized, giving him no choice but to make a difference in his life and the lives of many others. Upon learning of his recent HIV positive diagnostics and short thirty day life expectancy time span, Woodruff, reluctant to die, uses his hustling, smooth-talking, greasing ways to secure him a new, untested medicine to prolong the spread of HIV, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved AZT. After consuming an uncontrolled amount of AZT, the only legal drug that was available at the time in the United States, all the while, still abusing his substances, Woodruff has a close encounter with death. Coming to the morbid realization that the ATZ was depleting his longevity, he enlists the help of a disgraced doctor (Griffin Dunne) and together bring unapproved anti-viral treatments to the U.S illegally. What starts off as a simple economic money tapping market venture, Woodruff, along the way, comes to the realization that his efforts to help others, are actually working. Enlisting the help of fellow HID/AIDS victim Rayon (Jared Leto), the two start the Dallas Buyers Club, an alternative treatment centre for paying members that pits Woodruff in a gestating face-to-face with the FDA and other pharmaceutical companies. As the clientele grows thanks to Rayon뗩 introduction to the biggest HIV/AIDS demographic, homosexuals, Woodruff has a revelation that not only changes his opinion of gays but also is a deep and dark look of sexual discrimination in the south of the U.S in the 1980쑙. Dallas Buyers Club is a film dependent on the skills of its actors physical and mental performances. Aside from McConaughey땁 drastic forty pound weight loss, supporting actor Jared Leto dropped a hefty amount of weight to play the utterly convincing transsexual Rayon. Veering far away from Christian Bale comparisons in his eerie and grotesque turn as Trevor Reznik in Brad Anderson 2004쑙 indie The Machinist, the two leads in the Dallas Buyers Club abandon physical spectacle in exchange for allowing their on-screen presence to give a candid, historical accuracy of HIV/AIDS patients, and the brutal struggle they faced against a deadly and unforgiving epidemic in the United States in the 1980쑙. Dallas Buyers Club is McConaughey뗩 best role yet. Fierce, trashy and edifying, the actor substitutes humility for profanity, glamour for wretchedness, and the light-hearted for the heavy and unapologetic. Finally, McConaughey joins a club of actors that he should be proud to be a part of. Although the year뗩 lead actor category is going to be a full one at this year뗩 Academy Awards, the Supporting Actor category will have a clear winner. Unrecognizable, subtle and submerged into the role, their is no deny or ignoring the raw talent Leto brings to the role of Rayon. His previous efforts as a dedicated method actor, either gaining a large amount of weight or shedding weight with a wink of an eye, Leto땁 dedication to the craft is showcased in Dallas Buyers Club, and will surely be rewarded.", :useful=>[0.0, 0], :username=>"NightReviews", :date=>"Nov 11, 2013", :location=>nil, :title=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"metacritic", :url=>"http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dallas-buyers-club"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"Since before the start of the new millennium until just after 2010, Matthew McConaughey땁 body of work was just that, a body that worked well on the screen for so many of the aimless, brainless onslaught of romantic/comedy disasters, in which he played the lead.

At a time when HIV was poorly understood and research to treat theIt is the mid-80s and the AIDS causing virus is swiftly become a concerning epidemic in America. Little is known about the disease, littler known is its treatment, and its latest victim is Ron Woodroof  a blue collar, hustler and straight-up Texas cowboy and he going out swinging hard, creating the Dallas Buyers Club. At a time when HIV was poorly understood and research to treat the virus was slow moving, in part by the FDA, diagnosis was a death sentence. With a startlingly low 30 day prognosis, Woodroof is just bullheaded enough attempt to outlive his prognosis, by any means necessary despite the legal ramifications. Based on a true story, Dallas Buyers Clubs tells of Woodroof뗩 quest for medication, bypassing regulation, by heading straight to Mexico. Along the way he sees a booming market of desperate people, and creates a members-only club with an unlikely business partner Rayon, a trans woman. Matthew McConaughey plays the machismo Ron Woodroof and his casting could not be more on point. Who else can play a Texas cowboy than Hollywood뗩 own leading man? His commitment to the character is obvious due to his physical transformation and withered frame of a deathly ill man. The role was made for him and that might be the problem  it feels like he is just being Matthew McConaughey with AIDS. The real star of the film is the trans business partner Rayon. Jared Leto is pure and true in his portrayal of the trans Rayon, albeit a bit hokey. He is transcendent, there is absolutely not a drop of Leto visible, not for even a fraction of a second. Once Leto뗩 character is introduced the movie takes a powerful step in the direction of captivating Oscar worthy cinema. In less capable hands this story could have easily been sappy, bland, and straight-forward.

As the movie opens, it is July, 1985 (we see a newspaper headline about Rock Hudson being outed with AIDS), and we are at a rodeo in Dallas where Woodroof is getting it on with two girls at the same time, while also placing bets on rodeo riders. A picture is quickly painted of Woodroof as the Texan wild and crazy guy. Yet soon we see him struggling, coughing and generally not feeling well and when he is admitted in the hospital, he gets the shocking news that he is HIV positive and is given only 30 days to live by the doctors. Woodroof goes ballistic and refuses to accept his fate, only to find that the FDA is allowing only one approved drug (ATZ) on the market. Woodroof eventually finds alternative medications in Mexico. To tell you much more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, let's talk about Matthew McConaughey's performance. He will simply blow you away. The very first shot of him (a head shot, in which he physically already looks terrible) is pretty shocking, to be honest (McConaughey reportedly lost 40 lbs. for the film). This role continue's McConaughey's recent string of top notch performances (Mud, Killer Joe, Bernie, The Paperboy, just to name those), and surely he will (or at least should) get strong consideration for a Best Actor Oscar nomination. (It just makes you wish that McConaughey wouldn't have wasted so many years playing those tiresome rom-com roles time and again.) Second, much has been said as well about Jared Leto's role. He first appears about 30 min. into the movie as the cross-gender dressing gay Rayon, to become Woodroof's business partner. It most certainly is a great performance (and is openly touted for Best Supporting Actor Oscar) but in my book, it doesn't come anywhere close to McConaughey's. Jennifer Garner has a small role as one of the Dallas Mercy hospital doctors, and gets completely blown away by both McConaughey and Leto. Third, this movie is most capably directed by Canadian Jean-Marc Vallee, who most recently brought us the excellent \"Caf칠 de Flore\". Fourth, the movie does not put either the FDA or Big Pharma in a kind light, as we are given the impression that both are in cahoots and do not care what is best for the public at large (I have no idea to what extent this was or is the case). Last but not least, there is an excellent collection of songs featured in the movie, with many staples from the 1970s and 80s including a number of T Rex songs (Rayon is obsessed with T Rex's Marc Bolan). But beware: the movie soundtrack (which is available here on Amazon) features primarily music \"inspired by\", rather then \"from\" the movie, and is not an accurate reflection of what you hear in the movie.\"Dallas Buyers Club\" makes for an emotionally invested and moving experience that will tuck at your heart. But the acting performance from McConaughey is what makes this movie profoundly memorable. The screening I saw this act recently here in Cincinnati (where it's been playing already several weeks) was PACKED, leading me to think that this movie will find a larger audience, which is great news.

He also likes a little \"smack\" to go with his women and his booze.His negligence gets him a full blown case of HIV and ultimately AIDS.

His ill-gotten supply eventually runs out so he goes to Mexico to get some new treatment, none of which includes AZT or any other hard drug for that matter.Given that AIDS mostly affected homosexual men at the time, Woodroof was ostracized by his friends and co-workers.  He eventually has to put his homophobic beliefs aside and works with another patient at the hospital to create a \"club\" where membership includes free medicine.  This sidesteps the law against bringing drugs of any kind into the country and reselling them without a proper license.His friend Rayon (a memorable performance by Jared Leto) becomes his assistant and recruiter.

A sexually active, straight, carousing, drug abusing Texas rodeo cowboy collapses. At the hospital he is told he has HIV and has less than thirty days to live. Does he succumb to the diagnosis, or does something else happen entirely?Dallas Buyers Club is based on a true story about Ron Woodruff. I must admit I was unfamiliar with this movie. The ticket seller gave me an unconvincing outline, and I was about to walk away when a couple overhearing our conversation assured me it was a good movie.I am glad to say they were correct. This is the exact type of movie that wins Oscars, and gets many nominations.Matthew Mc Conaughey deserves to be nominated for playing someone battling a deadly disease who takes on big drugs and the FDA, to enable other sufferers like himself to have access to supplements and life saving drugs. He reputedly lost about 40 pounds for the role, and at times does look very gaunt, which gives an added layer of reality to his portrayal.This is a multi faceted movie full of interesting characters, which operates on multiple levels at once. The personal struggle, the parallel struggles and contrasts, and the battle against different facets of authority. Jennifer Garner in a supporting role plays a feisty yet compassionate doctor, while a colleague with more of an eye to profit becomes a doctor shill for big drugs, which are experimental, still unproven, and in the clinical trial stage, and may have toxic side effects, while our protagonist has to chase down a caring and competent doctor in Mexico who was disbarred, for less toxic alternatives.Why does one experimental method, with an unproven drug, take priority over drugs that are unapproved by the FDA? Aren't drugs undergoing clinical trials also unapproved? In both cases aren't people offering themselves as guinea pigs, and why shouldn't they be allowed to do that? After all, it is their lives.I loved this movie, and I found the story far more engaging than I thought I would beforehand. I was particularly intrigued and a little surprised by how hard hitting it was against the FDA, and the role it plays in connection with the big pharmaceutical companies, and how it restricts our access even to harmless supplements.I love it when a character is resourceful, so I loved the answers he gives an FDA official when he is stopped and questioned at the border.As often happens in a movie of this nature, there is more than one great performance. An unrecognizable Jared Leto gives a breathtaking performance as a gaunt transgender woman also undergoing treatment who Ron meets, and who sources customers for him. Ray like others has to deal with Ron's homophobia, and it's refreshing to see how it plays out as the character develops. What I love is the journey the character makes through being confronted with his own mortality, and how that affects a wider circle of people.If Leto does not get an Oscar nomination for his role then there is no justice in Hollywood. He would have to be a leading contender for Best Supporting Actor, as Matthew McConaughey would be for Best Actor.One thing that has impressed me in recent years is McConaughey's transition from lightweight romcom, and pretty boy roles, to more challenging roles. For instance, I consider Lincoln Lawyer to be one of his best roles as a wheeler dealer lawyer but not the type of role for which an actor is typically nominated. He battles the system but has no weakness.Actors win Oscars for playing two types of roles:One is the psychopath, such as Daniel Day Lewis for There Will Be Blood, Javier Bardem for No Country for Old Men, and Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter.The second is actors battling disabilities or diseases and/or social injustice. Recently Octavia Spenser won for playing a maid dealing with racial discrimination, Meryl Streep for playing a Prime Minister battling alzheimers, and Christian Bale for playing a former boxer battling drug addiction. Jennifer Lawrence won playing a character battling grief who acts out sexually. Bradley Cooper was nominated for playing someone with bipolar disorder in the same movie. Jeff Bridges won an alcoholic country singer. More recently the trend has been moving toward playing real life characters.As often happens the best movies of the year are released in December and timed for an Oscar run.

Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey in an absolutely amazing performance) is a 35-year-old electrician and rodeo hanger-on who lives hard and parties harder, everything from smoking and drinking to drugs and careless sex.  When an injury on the job ends up sending him to the hospital, the doctors there do some tests and awkwardly inform him that he tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. They then inform him that he should start putting his affairs in order as they estimate that he only has maybe thirty days to live. Ron, a stereotypical homophobic redneck, angrily rejects the diagnosis, believing - as most people did back then - that AIDS was something only \"f[expletive for homosexual]s\" got, the mere implication being more offensive to him than the potential death-threat of the disease.Woodroof immerses himself in booze and drug binge denial at first.  But when thinking about something he read - about how some people get AIDS from intravenous drug use - he reflects on some past behavior and comes to the realization that the diagnosis is probably true. Snapping himself out of his depression, he begins to read everything he can find on AIDS, particularly on treatment research.  At the time, the drug AZT was the only thing that seemed to show any promise at combatting the disease.  The problem though was that AZT was only in the clinical trials stage in the US, a process which was going to take a year before the drug could be approved by the FDA for doctors to prescribe to patients.  Facing a 30-day diagnosis, a year's wait was a death sentence for people like Woodroof.  Refusing to accept the situation, and faced with no way to legally buy the drug, Woodroof sets out to get it any way he can. Eventually he ends up going to Mexico to a clinic run by a Dr. Vass (Griffin Dunne), an American physician whose license was revoked for violating US regulations in his AIDS-related work. Dr. Vass puts Ron on a cocktail of other drugs, along with some vitamins, that he believes are more effective in treating the symptoms of AIDS, there being no known way of treating the HIV virus itself.Seeing an opportunity, Ron begins to buy up large stockpiles of the unapproved drugs and vitamins and smuggle them into the US, not only for his own use but for sale to other HIV+ persons to help pay for the costs of his own treatment. To broaden his reach, the still very homophobic Woodroof enters into an unlikely partnership with a transvestite named Rayon (Jared Leto in an equally bravura performace), a fellow HIV patient, who he met during a stay in the hospital, realizing that Rayon would have more contacts with AIDS patients in the gay community, which at the time was where the vast majority of them were. Eventually their questionably legal business grows into the Dallas Buyers Club, an organization that allows them to circumvent the law against selling the drugs by simply giving the drugs to members who have to pay a monthly fee for their memberships.A lot of what makes this movie worth seeing are the outstanding performances by Matthew McConaughey (Magic Mike, The Lincoln Lawyer) and Jared Leto (Requiem for a Dream, Lord of War), both of whom went to extraordinary lengths to make this film (McConaughey lost 50 pounds and Leto lost 30 pounds to achieve the gaunt look needed to portray the effects of AIDS over time). McConaughey is amazingly intense as he takes Woodroof first through the emotional gamut of dealing with the AIDS diagnosis, and then transforms himself as he shows Woodroof dealing with his situation with absolute determination to survive regardless of what it takes, rapidly adjusting his life and his views and calling on talents he never knew he had to become the person he needs to be -  and the person other people need him to be - to survive. Leto's Rayon is also a great character study, giving depth to his character by showing another side to Rayon's outer flamboyance, revealing things by his character's very unwillingness to reveal them.*** Warning - Possible spoiler in next paragraph ***But it is McConaughey who drives the film and who commands your attention.  One of the sequences that best shows the intensity McConaughey throws into his performance occurs as he shows Ron's life rapidly falling apart as news of his diagnosis spreads. His former friends turn on him, his co-workers refuse to let him on the job site, and finally he returns one night to his rented trailer only to find the door locked, an eviction notice taped to it, and the words \"F[expletive for homosexual] Blood!\" spray-painted across the side. To which McConaughey's Ron responds in sheer rage, yelling to the silent trailers around him \"I still live here, you hear me?! I fu[expletive]in' live here!!\" He is _so_ not going gentle into that good night.*** End of possible spoiler - You may read safely from here on. :)  ***The rest of the cast is also quite good.  Jennifer Garner (Alias, Juno) is effective at bringing out the dilemmas of the time as Eve Saks, the doctor who gets to know both Woodroof and Rayon, caught between her desire to help and the restrictions put on her by the medical bureaucracy, particularly as she comes to doubt the approved approach both in terms of its effectiveness and its motivations. And Steve Zahn (Treme, Diary of a Wimpy Kid) provides a nice counter-balance as Ron's sympathetic brother Tucker, a Dallas cop caught between enforcing the law and the ties of family.What's also remarkable about Dallas Buyers Club is that it was made on a comparative shoestring budget - just $5M - most of which McConaughey had to raise himself. And yet it looks better than half of the big-budget films hitting theaters these days.  And partly because of this, there's a leanness to the feel of the film that fits the core story, where time matters and no moment can afford to be wasted.Highly, highly recommended, not only for McConaughey and Leto's outstanding performances but for its portrayal of people struggling against not only a procedure-bound medical bureaucracy but also against a system geared against them by the enormous influence of pharmaceutical companies", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[19, 23], :date=>" 2014 January 20", :title=>"Matthew McConaughey is outstanding as Ron Woodroof",

After viewing this moving story, I can certainly see why. Director Jean-Marc Vall칠e (\"Young Victoria\") pulled off nothing short of a miracle when funding suddenly dried up and he filmed this in 25 days. He fed his cast on over-loaded credit cards.Through the use of dates (when initially diagnosed in 1985, our hero is given 30 days to live), we know that this actually happened; it is a brilliant script by two newcomers, Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack, who used Ron Woodroof's life to inform their script (he's \"Woodruff\" in the film). Last year I saw the excellent documentary \"How to Fight a Plague\" and feel that the time lines and the learning curve about AIDS are realistic and factual.Some of this terrific cast are:  * Matthew McConaughey (\"The Wolf of Wall Street\") is Ron Woodruff, a macho rodeo cowboy and hustler. When told his diagnosis he lets the doctor know in no uncertain terms, what he thinks of THAT: \"Straight men don' get AIDS!\" Mr. M. lost 45 pounds to add realism to his role.  * Jared Leto (\"Mr. Nobody\") is Rayon, a transgender wannabe who partners with our hero to form the Buyers Club, a gimmick that (temporarily) circumvents Texas law. He lost 40 pounds as well as waxed his body for this role.  * Jennifer Garner (\"Butter\") plays Eve, a doctor who sees the value of reducing the toxic doses of AZT, despite her medical colleagues and Big Pharma. See how that works for her!  * Denis O'Hare (\"J. Edgar\") is Dr. Sevard, the face we soon come to see as evil because he represents the implacability of the ADA and Big Pharma.  * Steve Zahn (\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\") is our hero's brother Tucker, a Dallas cop and an all-around good guy.  * Griffin Dunne (\"Broken City\") is Dr. Vass, an American doctor exiled to Mexico because of his unorthodox approach to HIV and AIDS.

A remarkable film which almost never got made but we are glad that it did.McConaughey is Ron Woodruf, a vulgar, mean rodeo type of character who is in to sex with many women, gambling, alcohol, fighting and gambling. An accidental electrocution sends him to the ER when his blood samples reveal that he has the AIDS virus and only thirty days to live. Being diagnosed with AIDS may not seem a big deal today but this movie is set in 1985, a time when such a diagnosis almost certainly meant death. But Woodruff won't give up easily and finds a janitor at the hospital to give him supplies of AZT, an experimental drug. When the janitor fails to produce AZT, he goes to Mexico to seek the help of a American physician who recommends a diet of vitamins and fatty acids. As his condition stabilizes. Ron decides to start a club with a 400 dollar enrollment fee to help others by buying medicines from the border.Mathew McConaughey is just amazing as Woodruff, as the drug addled sleazeball who finally comes in term with his own mortality. Here is an actor who almost faded away because of  his movie choices that enhanced cheesiness than chops. However the actor in him has woken up and we have seen in great movies such as Mud and Wolf of Wall Street. For this movie he lost almost 47 pounds to look the part. He starts out as a mean, menacing guy who deserves some punishment but towards the end he gains the respect and love of the audience. He was simply that good. A evil person who finally learns to love and to connect with humans.Another actor who is almost unrecognizable in drag,  but fantastic,  in drag is Jared Leto. He and Mcconaughey share an unbeatable chemistry. Leto is a transsexual and becomes a business partner to a reluctant Woodruff.  This is the fifth movie to win best actor & best supporting actor Oscars (for Matthew McConaughey & Jared Leto)Dallas buyers Club is a sparkling cocktail of chemistry between the two leads who bring life to the AIDS epidemic but also highlight the struggle of the individual against the goliaths such as big pharma, government and the epidemic itself.

It would be as if 12 Years a Slave had been told from the point of view of the Slave Master who was suffering from tired arms after whipping his housekeeper.What I mean is the protagonist is not a very likeable or likely hero in the Battle for Our Lives in the War on AIDS.  He's an ugly womanizing homophobe with a single redeeming quality, that being, he's tenacious as hell.  But aren't we all when our lives are on the line?  But this is called The Dallas Buyers Club and not The War on AIDS.  There is talk that it doesn't reflect the reality of Ron Woodruff, who some claim was bisexual.  But really, who cares?This was 2 movies.The first movie is the movie seen by those who know AIDS as something someone else has to worry about.  That's the majority of Americans.  They seem to like this movie and the characters as portrayed by McC and Leto.  We see him lose everything except his dignity on the way down and then we see him use his dignity as currency to rebuild his life even as those around him are losing theirs.  One of the saddest moments was when a straight woman shows up at his DBC and in the same moment we learn with him that she has full blown AIDS we hear them screwing their brains out and we understand.  I'm not sure we'd be as understanding if this was a movie about gays and it was two men doing that.Which brings me to the other movie.  And that's the film seen by those of us who have survived this long as the plague took everyone we knew and flushed them down the toilet of life.  For us this plague started as someone turned the lights out on the Disco ball and the Anti-Christ was elected to office.  The first wave seemed to be the hemophiliac kids whose neighbors, churches and schools made their last days a nightmare.  Then wave after wave of friends who would show up at happy hour with their diagnoses but otherwise looking fine.  They'd go on meds and be dead within months.  If they were lucky enough to have a partner the next few months was filled with nausea and diarrhea, night sweats and a slow and painful death followed by the deadpatient's family, most of whom had written off their gay sibling, coming to claim their loot often times leaving the partner in an empty home or on the street.  It is a memory of ACT-UP, a giant quilt, cancelled insurance plans.  Friends found hanging in their basement days after getting their diagnosis and funeral after funeral, sometimes two a day for about 10 years.  None of them had a nickel to join a buyers club though we heard they were starting up in places like NYC and SFO.  But ACT-UP took care of that and soon everyone could get a drug that had once been shelved for side effects and lack of efficacy but which soon became the most expensive drug ever produced.  And after Ryan White was terrorized by his friends, school and church Congress finally got the courage to pass the Ryan White Act which made those drugs available to everyone through State run plans.  Yes the drug companies made a fortune as did their investors.  We were the largest running experiment in the history of the world as millions of us signed up for every test, every med, any chance at a cure and we still died by the boatloads.It is 30 years later and American still can't make a movie about the horror we experienced as a nation because the nation didn't experience it.  They left us to die or fight for our lives on our own and then got snippy because we were successful and jealous that our dying became a cause celebre.  I've lost dozens of close friends and many more dozens of acquaintences.  For us this movie doesn't show the face of AIDS in America, though as expected, the gay guy does die but the protagonist's death is told to us in white text on a black screen right before the credits roll.  One wonders who claimed the body.  But considering the movie is not called Cowboy with AIDS or AIDS in America the ultimate fate of the subject of the movie, the actual Dallas Buyers Club seemed like a footnote.  The same kind of footnote this movie made of the milions who weren't theoretically straight cowboys who learned to tolerate a drag queen/trans/whatever.  This film didn't even really dignify Leto's character with any real depth other than just another boy in a dress.It must have been a tough roll for McC to play and for that he deserves an award.  Leto seemed a bit comfortable in his role which earned him an award.  But the Academy was smart in leaving it there because the fact is, as a movie, it just kind of sucked in so many ways and the more I think about it the more offensive it becomes.But it's worth the watch even if it offends more than it uplifts.", :rating=>2.0, :percentage=>40.0, :useful=>[20, 29], :date=>" 2014 March 4", :title=>"A Tale of Two Films", :location=>"(Washington, DC)", :username=>"T.

Presidential elections, foreign policy issues gone awry, joblessness, the war on drugs, \"Just say no\", then along with this unrest was the balance of a false lulling of stability, which was easy to be secure in. Then HIV-AIDS hit like a hurricane, leaving us all baffled, unaware and totally perplexed.  Especially for the subject, Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey), who is a hard playing Texas rodeo man, a good old boy along with his other homophobic cowboy friends.  A drug user and womanizer, he set the precedence of how we were still quite unaware and ignorant of how one would acquire HIV at the time.  Upon reaching 1985, by the time of his diagnosis, Ron starts to fight his prognosis; which is,You've got 30 days to live.  Get your affairs in order.He begins to learn all different ways that the medicine companies do, more so do not, work with the doctors and patients to help find the cure for this awful disease.  Ron learns that the side-effects are more deadly than most anything else and that the real medicines to help cannot be gotten here in the U.S.  They are labeled unapproved although not illegal.  This puts anybody in the middle of a paradox where life sustaining medicines cannot be gained merely because of testing technicalities and a great lack of supportive funding to back it.While Ron returns to the hospital to inquire about AZT and how to gain more of this medicine, he meets up with the compassionate and sympathetic doctor who was there during his diagnosis, Eve (Jennifer Garner). While she is informing him that there are still no procedures available, none similar to the AZT trials.  No matter how hard Ron is trying to find ways around these, each of his ideas are thwarted. A man is observing the conversation across the hall from them, Rayon (Jared Leto), who is a homosexual man and a transvestite with HIV himself.  He too is looking for help, extremely ill and not receiving anything real.During such travail with these two men and a huge dichotomy in his Law Enforcement brother, Tucker (Steve Zahn), with the legalities of this all concerning his brother's life and his own sworn oath to uphold the law, the sufferings of everyone are even more apparent. Ron starts believing they could be helpful to one another, Rayon and himself, so they begin the \"Dallas Buyers Club\".  Instead of having people with their illness purchase separate doses of medications and/or supplements, they have them join their club of members for a fee.  Ron frequently travels down to Mexico to see a Dr. there (Griffin Dunne) who used to be one in the U.S. and transports these unapproved medicines back to the States.  It takes time for the Ron and Rayon to achieve their success,  Ron has to overcome his own homophobic tendencies concerning Rayon.  With all the emotion of human tragedy, this story plays out at every angle and in every way with an overwhelming amount of desperation in Ron and their members.The complete standout of this 'based on a true story' movie is its character portrayals.  They are more than stellar when considering each McConaughey and Leto dropped an estimated forty pounds off of their already slim bodies.  They appeared emaciated, gaunt and vaguely skeletal, offering this terrifying state from the very start.  From the very beginning, it shocked me to see this and the unrecognizable Jared Leto.  If I didn't already know he was in this movie ahead of viewing, I would not have guessed it.  I seriously doubt that I could have.Jean-Marc Vallee directs this American horror story in a linear fashion. Without veering off into subplots to take the focus off of the outstanding pain, the central characters are experiencing.  The cinematographer (Yves Belanger) does a wonderful, if not masterful, job showing in exquisite detail every emotion to be felt. The scene concerning Woodroof in the single lit, very darkened room with a bevy of butterflies is superlative in every way.  Belanger captures the emotion of being so alone while being so surrounded in a single moment.  Surrounded also by what could potentially save his life, but no way to capture it is palpably horrific in its full understanding.  The camera work in this movie is very nuanced and doesn't miss the small things, the things you want, more so, have to see that capture a person, feeling, or an emotion. The \"Dallas Buyers Club\" is an extremely dark thematic movie that sheds light onto a time that we couldn't understand.  All we knew of the time was we could feel it. Feel totally helpless during it, feel it horrifically and this is exactly what the movie delivers.", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[7, 10], :date=>" 2014 February 15",

It's not unusual for an actor or\nactress to alter their physical appearance for a movie role. Sometimes\nthose changes become the story: Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull and\nChristian Bale in The Machinist are two that come to mind. Regardless\nof the transformation or make-up, what really matters is the\nperformance and the character. Just ask Eddie Murphy (Norbit) or\nGwyneth Paltrow (Shallow Hal). In The Dallas Buyers Club, we actually\nget two incredible transformations that lead to two stunning\nperformances.Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto each lost approximately 40 pounds\nfor their respective roles as Ron Woodroof, the redneck, three-way\nloving, alcoholic, drug-addicted electrician/rodeo cowboy; and Rayon,\nthe sensitive, street-savvy, would-be transsexual so desperate for a\nkind word. Their physical appearance will startle you more than once,\nbut is quite effective in getting across the struggles of those\ninfected with HIV virus in the 1980's. The numbers impacted exploded\nand the medical profession was ill-equipped to properly treat the\npatients.This is based on a true story and a real life guy (Woodroof) who became\na most unlikely beacon of hope for AIDS patients. Woodroof fought the\nmedical industry, Pharmaceutical companies and the government (FDA,\nDEA, IRS). It's impossible to miss the message and accusations that\nmost of these had a single goal of increasing profits, rather than\ncuring the disease. And that's where the story lags a bit. Michael\nO'Neill and Dennis O'Hare are the faces of greed and bureaucracy, while\nJennifer Garner, Leto, and Griffin Dunne represent the side with a\nheart. Woodroof seems to be a guy who just doesn't want to die, sees a\nbusiness opportunity, and even learns a little bit about humanity along\nthe way.There have been numerous other projects that deal with AIDS, including:\nPhiladelphia with Tom Hanks and the recent documentary How to Survive a\nPlague. This may be the first with a protagonist who is simply\nunlikeable, despite his passion and strong survival instincts.\nMcConaughey doesn't shy away from the homophobic personality and cruel\nmanner of speech that Woodroof possesses. We never doubt his\nfrustration at those controlling the big picture, but we never really\nsee him connect with those his brash tactics help.McConaughey is on a dream run as an actor right now, and it certainly\nwouldn't be surprising to see him garner an Oscar nomination. But it\nwould be a mistake to chalk that up to his losing so much weight - he\nreally delivers a character that we won't soon forget. And let's not\noverlook Mr. Leto, who has been away from acting for 4 years touring\nwith his band. He is a remarkable talent and a true screen presence.\nCompare this role to his Mark David Chapman in Chapter 27. It's not\njust the range of weight, but moreso the range in acting that so\nimpresses.Also worth noting here is the outstanding cinematography of Yves\nBelanger. This movie is shot in a way that brings out the intimacy of\nthe moments, while not losing the big picture. Director Jean-Marc\nVallee (The Young Victoria) and co-writers Craig Borten and Melisa\nWallack work together for a solid foundation, but it's McConaughey and\nLeto that we will most remember ... and of course, the pics of the\ngreat Marc Bolan on the wall. www.MovieReviewsFromTheDark.wordpress.com\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790636/"},

:username=>"lucasnochez", :location=>"from Canada", :date=>"11 November 2013", :content=>"\nSince before the start of the new millennium until just after 2010, \r\nMatthew McConaughey's body of work was just that, a body that worked \r\nwell on the screen for so many of the aimless, brainless onslaught of \r\nromantic/comedy disasters, in which he played the lead. In 1996, \r\nMcConaughey played Jake Tyler Brigance in Joel Schumacher's A Time To \r\nKill. Hailed as the best performance of his career, it seemed like, \r\ncritically, that was the closest the actor would get to any praise.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, McConaughey took the lead in Brad Furman's The Lincoln Lawyer, \r\na by-the-number crime/mystery, where, McConaughey was able to flex some \r\nof his acting muscles as opposed to abdomen muscles. Since then, in \r\nwhat has been the most sudden and misunderstood acting turn in recent \r\nmemory, McConaughey has reinvented his career and is continuing to be \r\ncasted as a serious actor with serious acting skills.\r\n\r\nWhile the Texan acting inspiration has remolded his career in a time \r\nspan that puts to shame that of Downey Jr. and Travolta, one of \r\nMcConaughey's unflinching signature acting staples is his bold and \r\nproud Texan accent. And while I can't really imagine how a cowboy like \r\nhimself was cast in Christopher Nolan's upcoming science fiction \r\nInterstellar, McConaughey and his accent were surely a match made in \r\nheaven for his role as the slowly weathering and dying HIV/AIDS patient \r\nRon Woodruff.\r\n\r\nFor Dallas Buyers Club, McConaughey and his accent worked exceptionally \r\nwell. Quebecois director Jean-Marc Vallee helms McConaughey as Ron \r\nWoodruff; a rugged, homophobic, ultra- macho, bull-riding, money \r\nthrowing, playboy with no accord to anyone. Woodruff, a money hustling, \r\nchance taking electrician juggles his fortune, his luck, his women, and \r\nhis job to make ends meet and live a somewhat fulfilling life. It isn't \r\nuntil an unexpected accident at work that leaves Woodruff hospitalized, \r\ngiving him no choice but to make a difference in his life and the lives \r\nof many others.\r\n\r\nUpon learning of his recent HIV positive diagnostics and short thirty \r\nday life expectancy time span, Woodruff, reluctant to die, uses his \r\nhustling, smooth-talking, greasing ways to secure him a new, untested \r\nmedicine to prolong the spread of HIV, the FDA (Food and Drug \r\nAdministration) approved AZT. After consuming an uncontrolled amount of \r\nAZT, the only legal drug that was available at the time in the United \r\nStates, all the while, still abusing his substances, Woodruff has a \r\nclose encounter with death. Coming to the morbid realization that the \r\nATZ was depleting his longevity, he enlists the help of a disgraced \r\ndoctor (Griffin Dunne) and together bring unapproved anti-viral \r\ntreatments to the U.S illegally. What starts off as a simple economic \r\nmoney tapping market venture, Woodruff, along the way, comes to the \r\nrealization that his efforts to help others, are actually working. \r\nEnlisting the help of fellow HID/AIDS victim Rayon (Jared Leto), the \r\ntwo start the Dallas Buyers Club, an alternative treatment centre for \r\npaying members that pits Woodruff in a gestating face-to-face with the \r\nFDA and other pharmaceutical companies. As the clientele grows thanks \r\nto Rayon's introduction to the biggest HIV/AIDS demographic, \r\nhomosexuals, Woodruff has a revelation that not only changes his \r\nopinion of gays but also is a deep and dark look of sexual \r\ndiscrimination in the south of the U.S in the 1980쑙.\r\n\r\nDallas Buyers Club is a film dependent on the skills of its actors \r\nphysical and mental performances. Aside from McConaughey's drastic \r\nforty pound weight loss, supporting actor Jared Leto dropped a hefty \r\namount of weight to play the utterly convincing transsexual Rayon. \r\nVeering far away from Christian Bale comparisons in his eerie and \r\ngrotesque turn as Trevor Reznik in Brad Anderson 2004쑙 indie The \r\nMachinist, the two leads in the Dallas Buyers Club abandon physical \r\nspectacle in exchange for allowing their on-screen presence to give a \r\ncandid, historical accuracy of HIV/AIDS patients, and the brutal \r\nstruggle they faced against a deadly and unforgiving epidemic in the \r\nUnited States in the 1980쑙.\r\n\r\nDallas Buyers Club is McConaughey's best role yet. Fierce, trashy and \r\nedifying, the actor substitutes humility for profanity, glamour for \r\nwretchedness, and the light-hearted for the heavy and unapologetic. \r\nFinally, McConaughey joins a club of actors that he should be proud to \r\nbe a part of.\r\n\r\nAlthough the year's lead actor category is going to be a full one at \r\nthis year's Academy Awards, the Supporting Actor category will have a \r\nclear winner. Unrecognizable, subtle and submerged into the role, their \r\nis no deny or ignoring the raw talent Leto brings to the role of Rayon. \r\nHis previous efforts as a dedicated method actor, either gaining a \r\nlarge amount of weight or shedding weight with a wink of an eye, Leto's \r\ndedication to the craft is showcased in Dallas Buyers Club, and will \r\nsurely be rewarded.\r\n\r\nDallas Buyers Club is a morally, heavy-hitting drama with lasting \r\neffects. Dramatizing the social discrimination of gays in the South of \r\nthe United States and the condition of many low-income, trailer-park \r\nliving American residents, the film raises the questions whether or not \r\nAIDS/HIVS and other fatal diseases are fairly treated within government \r\nfine print and whether the main goal of such large and powerful \r\ncompanies is wealth, or health.\r\n\r\nGritty, raw and compelling, Dallas Buyers Club is a powerfully dramatic \r\nbased on a true story. Woodruff was a simple man, whose unfortunate \r\ncondition brought forth an incredible man who's zest for life inspires \r\nothers. Ron Woodruff definitely rode the bull in life; challenging the \r\npowerful FDA, pharmaceutical companies and notions that were instilled \r\nin his since birth. Thankfully for us, Vallee, McConaughey and Leto \r\nride the film into a place in our hearts, in an overly sexualized, \r\npassionate display of what it's like to die \"with your boots on\"; \r\ndirty, gritty and with a fighting chance.\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790636/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"\nSince before the start of the new

Given a fully explored and\ndeveloped character, he is the centrifugal force of the engaging plot\nof an American tragedy, seamless direction, lively dialogue and creme\nde la creme supporting actors. This actor, who proves he can blur the\nlines between acting and real, rises to the ranks of Dustin Hoffman,\nSean Penn, Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, our Grand Pere, Jack Nicholson,\nand his own idol, Paul Newman. Unquestionably, he deserves a spot in\nAcademy Awards for Best Actor.

After getting an\nillegal supply of AZT, Ron finds that this isn't doing anything to help\nhim. Eventually fleeing to Mexico, Ron learns of and begins to take a\nparticular drug that hasn't been approved in the U.S. When he finds\nthat this drug is improving his health, Ron sees an opportunity. After\nsmuggling the drugs across the border, Ron, and another HIV patient\nnamed Rayon (Jared Leto) begins selling the drug to other citizens with\nthe virus. During the process, Ron battles the medical field and the\nlaw in order to prove how beneficial his buyer's club is.Based on the true story of the real Ron Woodroof, Dallas Buyers Club\nfollow one man's actions on his mission to survive and how he started a\nrevolution in a time when HIV/AIDS was a major issue. The story itself,\nnot only is interesting, but it doesn't contain a dull moments. It\nfilled with dramatic elements with dashes of comedic moments. It also\nfeatures characters that we come to find ourselves close to. Every one\nof which gets their own time to shine. The film does jump around quite\na bit, but it does so for the sake of the story and the events that are\nto come, and through every major point in Woodroof's life and battle\nwith HIV.Among the cast is Matthew McConaughey who easily gives the performance\nof his career as the blunt and clever Ron Woodroof. McCoaughey conveys\ndifferent aspects of Woodroof with such ease. There are moments where\nhe portrays Woodroof as being tough as nails, but then he can instantly\nshift gears into his emotional side. The comic relief aspects also come\noff completely natural. Jennifer Garner stars as Woodroof's female\ndoctor friend Eve Saks. Garner does a fine job of giving off her charm\nas she always does, but with this performance we see the conflict her\ncharacter is battling between her career and doing what is right. But\nthe one actor who stands out the most is Jared Leto as the\ncross-dressing Rayon. Leto provides not only a lot of the major comic\nrelief, but he also brings the heart of the story. We are shown Rayon\nas this carefree, happy-go-lucky character, but eventually we are shown\njust deeply affected this disease brings him emotionally, and Leto\nbrings all of this to the table flawlessly.Dallas Buyers Club is completely deserving of all of its Oscar buzz.\nFrom its powerful story, to its outstanding performances by the two\nleading males.

1980s, patients were\nadvised to wait. In the six years following the first recording of the\nAIDS outbreak in 1981, more than 40,000 people in the U.S. died while\nwaiting. In response to the clamor for action on the AIDS crisis, then\nVice President George H.W. Bush has been quoted as saying \"If you want\nchange, change your behavior.\" Roger Ebert recalls, \"Politicians did\nnot want to be associated with the disease. Hospitals resisted\nadmitting victims, and when an AIDS victim died, some health-care\nworkers would place the body in a black garbage bag. Funeral homes\nrefused to accept the corpses.\" As described in David France's documentary How to Survive a Plague,\nactivists such as the New York-based organization ACT UP began to\nprotest against the government's callous indifference, challenging the\nFDA to change their drug approval procedure and the pharmaceutical\ncompanies to lower their prices and speed up their research process. In\naddition to the organized group protests, individuals also did their\npart and the determination of one unlikely crusader, electrician Ron\nWoodroof (Matthew McConaughey), a homophobic \"good ol' Texas party\nboy,\" is the centerpiece of Jean Marc-Vall칠e's gritty and hard-hitting\nDallas Buyers Club.Written by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack and based on real events, it\nis the story of Woodroof's personal struggles after being diagnosed\nwith AIDS and his efforts to spread public awareness of the disease and\nhelp reduce the suffering and extend the lives of AIDS patients. As the\nfilm opens, the heterosexual, drug-using and unabashedly promiscuous\nWoodroof receives the bad news from his doctors that he only has thirty\ndays to live. Reacting with vitriol, he storms out of the hospital,\ncursing and making homophobic slurs while accusing the staff of making\nthe wrong diagnosis.After thoroughly researching the disease, however, and accepting the\nidea of his serious illness, Woodroof hears of a clinical trial for the\nnew drug AZT, the only legal drug that was available at the time in the\nUnited States. His attempt, however, to become one of the participants\nis denied and he has to purchase the drug surreptitiously from an\norderly. Unfortunately, he soon finds out that the dosage of AZT he is\ntaking is toxic and his condition worsens. Refusing to give up, he\nvisits an unlicensed American doctor (Griffin Dunne) in Mexico who has\nhad some success with alternative treatments such as vitamins and\nprotein-based anti-viral drugs.Smuggling non-FDA approved experimental and alternative medicines into\nthe U.S., he creates a business that allows him to distribute the drugs\nfree of charge to AIDS patients who pay a monthly membership fee to\njoin his Dallas Buyers Club, one of many such clubs that sprang up\naround the country. Woodroof is assisted in his venture by the\ndrug-addicted transsexual Rayon (Jared Leto), a fellow patient that he\nmet during his hospitalization. Though the film's depiction of Rayon\ndoes little to break the gay stereotype, their mutual engagement in\nhelping AIDS victims helps Ron see his business partner in a different\nlight than on their first meeting.With the help of a sympathetic doctor, Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner),\nRayon and Woodroof work together while dodging Food and Drug\nAdministration enforcers and the wrath of the pharmaceutical companies.\nIn one of his best efforts, Matthew McConaughey, who lost 40 pounds for\nthe movie, delivers a brilliant performance as the emotionally volatile\nbut basically decent Woodroof. Though ultimately, not all alternative\ndrugs proved to be useful, Woodroof and Rayon's determination in the\nface of powerful interests helped paved the way for development of new\ntreatments, even though it took until the late 90s to come up with one\nthat was fully effective. As a result of their efforts and that of\ncountless others, HIV is no longer the death sentence it once was.\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790636/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"\nAt the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s, patients were\nadvised to wait.", :clean_text=>"at the beginning of the aids epidemic in the early s patients were advised to wait", :sentiment=>{:average=>0.285, :corrected_average=>0.28, :scores=>[0.0, 0.42, 0.28, 0.44], :total=>1.14}, :context_tags=>{}, :context_indexes=>{}, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[], :emphasis=>0.13}, {:index=>1, :text=>"In the six years following the first recording of the\nAIDS outbreak in 1981, more than 40,000 people in the U.S. died while\nwaiting.", :clean_text=>"in the six years following the first recording of the aids outbreak in more than people in the us died while waiting", :sentiment=>{:average=>-0.012499999999999983, :corrected_average=>-0.15, :scores=>[-0.3, -0.42, 0.545, 0.125], :total=>-0.04999999999999993}, :context_tags=>{}, :context_indexes=>{}, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[], :emphasis=>0.17}, {:index=>2, :text=>"In response to the clamor for action on the AIDS crisis, then\nVice President George H.W.

It's a fact! From someone who started a bright early career and worked with the likes of such quality directors as Richard Linklater, John Sayles, Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis, he soon drifted into the dreaded rom-com territory that's no better than drifting into obscurity altogether. His reputation wasn't amounting to his early promise and it seemed he would never recover. So when did it all go right for him then? Well, in 2011, he got back in tow with Linklater to do \"Bernie\" and followed that up with dark and blisteringly brave performances in William Friedkin's \"Killer Joe\", Lee Daniels'  \"The Paperboy\" and Steven Soderbergh's \"Magic Mike\". It didn't stop there, though. He continued his solid work in Jeff Nichols' \"Mud\" and a brief but excellent role in Martin Scorsese's \"The Wolf Of Wall Street\" before finally delivering this awards laden performance in \"Dallas Buyers Club\". The resurrection of his career is now complete and McConaughey's work has now, rightfully, gained the respect of critics and viewers alike.The true story of Ron Woodroof (McConaughey), a hard-drinking, homophobic, Texan Rodeo Rider who discovers one day that he's HIV positive. He's given 30 days to live but when he point-blank refuses to accept it, he learns all he can about the disease and gets involved in backmarket medicine that been proven to help, instead of the government issued treatment that was actually harming patients.In making it to the screen, the extraordinary true story of Ron Woodroof was one that was fraught with production problems. In the mid 90's it had Woody Harrelson attached to the lead with Dennis Hopper on directing duties before it's financial backing fell through. It then crossed the path of director Marc Forster with Brad Pitt taking on Woodroof. That also fell through before Craig Gillespie and Ryan Gosling entered into talks in 2008. Before anything was decided French/Canadian director Jean-Marc Vall츾춸e signed up and cast Matthew McConaughey in what's, arguably, the most powerful role he's ever had. Ron Woodroof is a fascinating character and McConaughey's embodiment of him is a tour-de-force performance. Dropping 40lbs, McConaughey's transformation is astonishing. He looks gaunt, withered and seriously ill and masterfully captures both the impending fate of Woodroof and his drive to survive. In order to survive, though, he had to go against medical practice and fight for the right to treat himself with drugs that were unapproved by the government. In doing so, he became somewhat of a saviour to AIDS victims across America during the 80's despite the government and the law fighting him at every step.It's an extraordinary story that's depicted with heart and passion and being shot on a relative shoestring budget, adds to it's palpable sense of realism. Granted, with a script that's lay in limbo for 20 years or so, there are some creaks and cracks and some slight distortions of facts and dramatic licence on show but this is a film that has a voice and one that demands to be heard. In fact, it's still relevant today. Not just for the community of HIV sufferers but across the treatment of many illnesses. An example being, the government refusal to accept that cannabis can be used for medicinal purposes and it's oils are known to help in cancer treatment. This, of course, doesn't suit the pharmaceutical companies and the business to be made from their \"legalised\" products. Comparisons have been made between \"Dallas Buyer's Club\" and Jonathan Demme's \"Philadelphia\" but I reckon the comparison extends further to Michael Mann's \"The Insider\" and another example of the small man fighting corporate business, as Jeffrey Wigand did with the tobacco industry.Comparisons aside, this is still a strong piece of work and it benefits massively from it's committed performers. Too often an actors physical transformation can suggest that that's enough to merit a great performance but McConaughey is more than that here. His acting, really is, top quality stuff and he's supported by Jared Leto with equally impressive commitment. These two actors have been sweeping the awards boards of late and if they go on to win the Oscar, I certainly wouldn't be arguing about it.Mark Walker", :title=>nil, :location=>nil,

Gritty, raw and compelling, Dallas Buyers Club is a powerfully dramatic based on a true story. Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto each lost approximately 40 pounds for their respective roles as Ron Woodroof, the redneck, three-way loving, alcoholic, drug-addicted electrician/rodeo cowboy; and Rayon, the sensitive, street-savvy, would-be transsexual so desperate for a kind word. Their physical appearance will startle you more than once, but is quite effective in getting across the struggles of those infected with HIV virus in the 1980's. Dallas Buyers Club is McConaughey's best role yet. Fierce, trashy and edifying, the actor substitutes humility for profanity, glamour for wretchedness, and the light-hearted for the heavy and unapologetic. Finally, McConaughey joins a club of actors that he should be proud to be a part of. This movie is shot in a way that brings out the intimacy of the moments, while not losing the big picture. Dallas Buyers Club is a morally, heavy-hitting drama with lasting effects. Dramatizing the social discrimination of gays in the South of the United States and the condition of many low-income, trailer-park living American residents, the film raises the questions whether or not AIDS/HIVS and other fatal diseases are fairly treated within government fine print and whether the main goal of such large and powerful companies is wealth, or health.  A powerful film that must be seen and I hope gets a lot of attention at least for its stars. It might not be something I'd watch again and again but it was still one of the best movies of the year.

Bennett Miller뗩 direction reflects this, and the several chilling shots he captures, for me made my experience within that screen. The film뗩 true story follows Mark Schulz as he trains to win the Gold medal for Wrestling at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, with the help of the multimillionaire John Du Pont. As usual difficult questions are posed and Foxcatcher again asks us a question, as so many films do, about America, and as Erin Whitney and Matthew Jacobs point out in their review for the Huffington Post, it is one that acts as 라 distant horror story for the 1% percent. The film comments heavily on this with the multimillionaire Du Pont as the man at the fore front of these comments understandably. For example Du Pont almost seems to have the Olympic Wrestling Schulz brothers simply because they form part of his trophy cabinet, as objects to play with at his disposal, which acts as an explanation for the films ending. But the compelling true story and character study, particularly in regards to John Du Pont (played by Steve Carrell), is the films strength and a fascinating one at that. It will probably be unknown to my generation. But as usual the story told here is different to the one that actually happened and on reading what did happen it seems that the film뗩 director, Bennett Miller, missed out on several details that could have made the story that much better. For example, although the film does pick up on Du Pont뗩 descent into madness to an extent, it doesn뗪 take the opportunity to make it obvious and although I appreciate subtlety I think it would have been even better otherwise. In the true story, Du Pont for example thought that his horses were sending him messages from Mars and he also frequently asked his wrestlers to check his attic for ghosts. This really would have been a test for Carrell and could have contributed to an already stellar performance by him. The film though is propelled forward by its performances that branch out past what these actors are typically known for, Channing Tatum (playing Mark Schulz) and Mark Ruffalo (playing Dave Schulz) for example. But it is Steve Carrell뗩 performance that manages to break through the story and again what roles he is generally known for, and the hole that he leaves allows for Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo to follow through it, and therefore still deserved of the praise they have received from others. These performances ultimately stop Foxcatcher from being defined as good for its story alone. Bennett Miller뗩 direction is good. As I mentioned several of the shots he captured really made my cinematic experience, the best of those featuring Du Pont releasing his horses out into the wild. We see Du Pont뗩 dark silhouette with his hands raised, urging his horses to flee and it looked great on screen. Although its story is good and its ensemble, headed up by Carrell, is brilliant Foxcatcher doesn뗪 bring anything new to the table, and although I didn뗪 expect it to, I did expect it to do more than it did. It뗩 a vague expression to say that and I뗤 lost for words really in how to describe why I뗤 not rating the film better, but it뗩 almost as if, thinking about it, the film was saved by its ensemble performances which will explain why so many will have it in their best films of 2015 lists come the end of the year.

It's all seen through the prism of shattered aspirations and hopelessness -A couple of brief thoughts on Foxcatcher: A fascinating, albeit slow, character-driven study of the corroded American dream, privilege, devotion and entitlement. The film's muted color palette is painterly - but a dash of sunshine/color here and there would have been a welcome respite from all the doom and gloom. It's all seen through the prism of shattered aspirations and hopelessness - we get it, Bennett Miller, you don't have to choke us with it! Mark Ruffalo's performance is the most effective, buoying the film with a much-needed warmth; he's the heart and soul of \"Foxcatcher\" (and of pretty much every film he's in). Steve Carell, while effectively frightening, needy and insecure as DuPont, seemingly had trouble fully committing to the performance - from time to time, a glimpse of \"The Office\"'s Michael Scott surfaces through all the layers of make-up. It's in a gesture, a mannerism - the prosthetics, once again (see: \"The Hours\"), prove distracting, making one focus on recognizing familiar aspect of the established celebrity personality, rather than the character being played. That said, there are several powerful moments where the actor truly shines, utilizing the gargantuan nose and thin lips to great (and greatly creepy) effect. Channing Tatum is technically the protagonist of the film, featured in almost every scene, and he's compelling to watch, imbuing his staple \"dumb-but-talented oaf\" character (see: \"Magic Mike\") with gravitas and a sense of purpose. Still, he weighs the already-heavy film down with a resolute seriousness. Crack a smile, just once, Channing! There are also moments where he overdoes it a bit, such as the sequence where he bashes through a mirror with his head, weeping and scowling. Method acting, folks! The film presents the final murder as totally random and unexpected - supposedly, that's how it happened in real life. It's effective on one level, but also made me wish the narrative had more of a sense of purpose, more of a drive, a momentum that led to this point. Miller's \"Moneyball\" was far more entertaining; this is more of a return to his \"Capote\" roots, where everything is meaningful and disconnected at the same time, and the final result drags.

Being from the Philadelphia area, the story was all that anyone talked about for weeks after the tragedy. Not only was Dave Schultz an Olympic gold medalist, but John du Pont and his family were such big personalities in these parts. It's not everyday you get to relive a local tragedy played out on film, but Director Bennett Miller has reenacted this story for the screen in hauntingly realistic fashion. Foxcatcher is going to leave you speechless. Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) is an Olympic gold medalist for wrestling who has ambitions of returning to the Olympics to win gold in the 1998 Seoul games. Life on the outside for the Olympic gold medalist isn't all fame and glory. Living alone in a run down apartment and living on ramen noodles in between workouts has become a way of life for the American hero. Mark's older brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo) is also an Olympic gold medal wrestler who is helping Mark get ready for the World Championships. A relationship that appears, on the surface, to be strained by jealousy on the part of Mark. Dave has won multiple championships, has a loving family with his wife Nancy (Sienna Miller), and their young children and steady employment, while Mark struggles with his place in life. Mark is determined to leave his own mark and get out of the shadow of his successful brother. John du Pont(Steve Carrell) is a multimillionaire sports enthusiast with aspirations of becoming a wrestling mentor. His dream is to have his wrestling facility, Foxcatcher Farms, be the official wrestling training site for the US Olympic team. What du Pont needs is an Olympic wrestler to train on his grounds and help begin to build his dream. After being contacted by du Pont's representatives, Mark flies to Pennsylvania to meet with the philanthropist and the two come to an agreement. The agreement not only allows Mark financial freedom, but also allows Mark to remove himself from Dave's influence. A divide between the brothers has been fortified and allows the influence of du Pont to take hold. It becomes quickly apparent that du Pont's aspirations of an athletic career were squandered by his conservative mother (Vanessa Redgrave), which has led the eccentric man-child to believe coaching to be his strongest asset. With little experience in molding young minds in the art of wrestling, it becomes abundantly clear that du Pont's interest appear nothing more than a mere hobby. Du Pont's power and influence have allowed him to exploit a young man who's in need of a father-figure and brainwashed him into believing that he's the answer Mark has been searching for. The influence of du Pont quickly takes hold on Mark and his life begins to spiral out of control. Determined to make Foxcatcher successful, du Pont hires the services of Mark's brother Dave to train the group for the Olympic trials, a move that does not sit well with Mark. Tensions begin to escalate between the three men and a mental chess game begins. Dave attempts to derail Mark's freefall and navigate du Pont's eclectic personality all the while trying to keep the team on track to meet its goal of becoming Olympic champs. As the story culminates with the death of Dave you can assume that things take a turn for the worse. It's the buildup to the event that stands apart from the rest of the story, the hows and the whys, and those things become the most chilling. Director Bennett Miller (Moneyball) has created a eerily mesmerizing depiction of manipulation and deceit and the cinematography of Greig Fraser (Zero Dark Thirty) is gripping. The performances by each of the three actors is spellbinding. Tatum allows his chiseled persona to omit vulnerability and allow for an emotionally driven performance of a life time. Mark Ruffalo is the calming force between two tides in this film and he allows for a balance sorely needed. Ruffalo is never overpowering and he allows his character to play off each of his costars and his brotherly relationship with Mark is wonderful. Steve Carrell is haunting as the eccentric du Pont. His transformation into this character, including the mannerisms and mental state, are truly a wonder and one of the most interesting performances of his career. Overall, Foxcatcher is a gripping film but albeit a long, slow one. A movie delayed nearly a year by the studio to \"complete\" the film is never a good sign, but the performances by Tatum and Carrell may push this one into contention for award consideration. This movie is not for everyone, fans of these actors earlier work may find the movie boring and uninteresting, but if you're looking for a good drama, this may be a film that would interest you.",

His self-indulgent dream of achieving personal patriotic glory by financing and training an Olympic team.  And two brothers닥oth Olympians닧rawn into his orbit of delusion for financial gain and, for one, because his previously promising career is fading.  These ingredients ignite in Foxcatcher, a fascinating and grim true-crime drama with outsize concerns (economic inequality, mental illness, the United States of America) and the depth and grit required to sustain and explore them.This is the best film Bennett Miller has directed so far, eclipsing the very fine duo of Capote and Moneyball.  For over two hours, he fashions an unyielding atmosphere of unease.  Tools at his disposal in this regard include overcast rural vistas, photographed so as to maximize the sense of frosted isolation, and the elegant intertwining of minimalist piano music and creeping silences.  He also slowly, but confidently shades and illuminates the trio of stranger-than-fiction characters under his microscope, bringing their various bonds (brother and brother, coach and athlete, master and servant) into ever sharper focus.  His actors do not fail him.  They may not strongly resemble one another, but Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum are convincing as siblings.  They at once care for, respect, and resent the other the way family members often do; their very physical movements indicate a shared lifetime of traumas and triumphs and a resulting bond beyond words.  The former is a charming and genuine presence as a paragon of athletic and domestic stability, the latter a volatile force of nature adrift in unproductive masculine angst and therefore ripe for manipulation.And beneath the disguise of a prosthetic proboscis, comic star and former Daily Show cast member Steve Carell delivers a disturbing and revelatory dramatic performance as John du Pont, an heir to one of the United States' most storied and venerable fortunes.  It is destined to be an iconic piece of acting.  The character of John is complex and hard to describe.  He is menacing, yet also vulnerable.  He is shy and stunted, yet clearly desperate to exhibit entrepreneurial confidence and flair.  (A self-loathing master of the universe?)  He is an aficionado다n avid fan of freestyle wrestling, a published ornithologist, a stamp collector닥ut never masters an interest or discipline, though he pays people to pretend he has.  Such contradictions and tensions are reflected in a performance which is grotesque and, in the strangest way, touching; we are tempted to understand and sympathize with this most peculiar man as he edges closer to the point of no moral return, but he is too frightening to let in for long.  The actor and the screenplay hint at potential justifications and motives for his behavior, ranging from an overbearing matriarch (played briefly and sharply by Vanessa Redgrave) to the psychological impact of unimaginable wealth as a birthright, while also preserving a certain haunting and tantalizing air of the inexplicable.", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[38, 46], :date=>" 2014 December 4", :title=>"A disturbing", :location=>"(Maryland, USA)", :username=>"D.

I'm not sure why I disliked Tatum so much, since I think I scrupulously avoided everything he was in before ever giving him a chance. Whatever. As someone interested in the martial arts, and a follower of MMA since I was a kid, I have great respect for wrestlers and wrestling (real wrestling, not the rehearsed, ridiculous WWE variety), and I was straight up horrified and righteously enraged when the plans were announced to cut wrestling from the Olympic games*. That's a bit off topic, however. With so many sensationalistic aspects, the film takes a thoughtful, restrained approach, and infuses the proceedings with the respect and gravity they merit. In lesser hands, this could have been terrible.Tatum has no problem finding his inner silent-sullen-bull-necked-monster, or his outer one. For all I know he's playing himself in 'Foxcatcher'... but I don't think that's the case. Regardless, he owns the role, and Mark Ruffalo is excellent as older brother Dave Schultz. Ruffalo always delivers a solid performance, whether it's 'Zodiac' or the 'Avengers', even if his portrayals rarely seem to differ from role to role; I think that's related more to his unusually low-key, almost uninflected way of speaking, than any faults as an actor. In 'Foxcatcher', though, he gets Dave Schultz right on every level, from the idiosyncrasies of his gait to the warm, gregarious personality that made him as likable and accessible as his younger brother was stoic and unreadable. And Steve Carell is clearly Oscar-hunting** as John Dupont, wearing prosthetic make-up to better replicate the appropriately birdlike physiognomy of the ornithologist, and capturing the man's hard-wired arrogance, jealousy and oddly conflicted oscillation between distraction and intense focus. Whether or not he's nominated, this is certainly Carell's finest performance.Director Bennett Miller (as well as co-writer Dan Futterman) has wandered into similar terrain before with the brilliant 'Capote', and uses the same sensitivity with 'Foxcatcher'. Both films prominently feature famous murder cases, but the blood is fresher in the Schultz killing, even close to two decades later. The scenes of training and competition are proof of the casts commitment; both Tatum and Ruffalo show off some real talent and ability on the mat, and give the viewer a glimpse of the kind of monumental drive it takes to succeed in wrestling at the highest level, where global competition is vicious. It also provides a look at the toll such ambition can take on athletes. Olympians devote their lives to a sport that gives back very little in monetary compensation, and not much more glory.Tatum managed to get around my initial objections quickly, in an early scene that begins as he's reading to himself from a sheet of paper. Then he's at a primary school podium, stone-faced, one arm extended with a gold medal dangling from his fist. He lets the audience of thirty or so disinterested first-graders stare in uncomprehending silence, then launches into an earnest speech that reveals a complete inability to effectively communicate with those outside the wrestling world. His crudely framed speech is cut mercifully short, to show him waiting in the school office as a dismissive official writes out his $20.00 check. 'And you're first name is Dave, or David?' she asks. 'No, I'm Mark. Mark Schultz', he replies. She stares at him blankly. 'We discussed this with someone, that I'd be coming today instead of Dave?...', he explains uncomfortably. She says nothing, but after a theatrical pause returns to writing, as if she thinks some kind of crime has been committed, but has decided not to pursue it. Mark feels defensive, obviously. 'We both won gold', he says. That scene sums up both the character and his situation, powerfully and efficiently.Mark Schultz and John Dupont were 'mirror opposites'. Schultz had the talent and the pride of achieving Olympic Gold, victory at the highest level; but he was living in abject poverty because of it. Dupont had more money than he could spend in two lifetimes, but he could never know what it's like to have the skill and talent that the Schultz brothers possessed. What began as a seemingly symbiotic relationship -- Dupont supporting Mark and giving him the things he needed to train and compete comfortably, Mark allowing Dupont to become a part of World Class competition and experience the thrill of winning vicariously -- became a parasitic one. Dupont knew the kind of things to say around Olympic athletes, manipulative patriotic jingoism that came easy for someone whose mansion sat on Valley Forge. But he grew tired of pretense, and began to make it clear that he viewed his athletes like his mother viewed her horses. He was not supporting them, he was trying to buy the Schultz brothers like his mother might buy her specially bred horses, her 'field hunters' (or 'Foxcatchers'). His petulance, conceit, and jealousy would eventually overwhelm his sanity, with tragic results. This is a powerful film on many levels, and a hard-won victory for all involved.P.S.: * (Instead of cutting wrestling, one of the most basic, essential forms of athletic competition, and one that dates back to ancient and even prehistoric Greece, drop the blade on synchronized swimming. Who the f**k would mourn synchronized swimming?)P.S.: **(Nicole Kidman won an Oscar for 'The Hours' in 2003, in which she wore a prosthetic nose; Robert De Niro wore a fake nose playing Jake LaMotta in 'Raging Bull', which won him the Oscar; Meryl Streep wore a prosthetic nose to play Margaret Thatcher in 'The Iron Lady', and won her third Oscar; Lee Marvin got an Oscar wearing a fake nose in 'Cat Ballou'; Jose Ferrer got the trend started in 1950, winning his Oscar for the original 'nose job', 'Cyrano De Bergerac'. If you're laying down money, Carell takes this Oscar race by a nose. That was terrible, I know. But actors/actresses who wear facial prosthetics or gain/cut weight for a role win surprisingly often. Charlize Theron's commitment to the role of a real-life female serial killer in 'Monster', which included gaining 30 pounds, shaving her eyebrows, and wearing prosthetics, made her virtually identical to the real Eileen Wournos, and got her the win for Best Actress. Seeing a former fashion model sacrifice vanity for a role like that is impressive.)", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[17, 21], :date=>" 2015 January 4", :title=>"The Cost of Victory", :location=>"(Ontario, Canada)", :username=>"C.

Foxcatcher is a great example of this. I really can't say that watching Foxcatcher is an enjoyable experience. Disturbing is more like it. And kind of fascinating, but that's all about the actors.I went into this one with no idea of what it was about. I mean, I had no clue at all other than my wife saying she thought it had something to do with boxing, which turned out to be wrong and only matters in that it explains that I had no expectations whatsoever. Even having no expectations, what I got was completely unexpected.The movie was kind of like watching a scorpion or a large spider crawling over your kids, and you can't do anything about it. It gives you the shivers and makes your skin crawl watching that... thing... creeping over your kids, and you just keep hoping it keeps going and doesn't stop to bite or sting. Watching spiders and scorpions and how they move can be pretty fascinating. It's just not enjoyable when they're on you or someone you care for.That said, the performances are amazing. I mean, seriously, they are fantastic.You can barely recognize Carell, and it's not because of the nose and makeup. His whole bearing is changed. The way he holds his head, the way he talks, his mannerisms. There's nothing Carell-ish about him, none of that frenetic energy he so often has. And he's creepy. He's a creepy, rich, old white dude, and he acts like it. I might not have known it was him if I hadn't known it was him. That Steve Carell was in it was about the only thing I knew about the movie going into it.Speaking of bearing, Tatum and Ruffalo were incredible. I don't know if I can even describe what they did. So they were playing Mark and David Shultz, wrestlers who both won gold at the 84 Olympics, and they had this way of moving their bodies around that more closely resembled chimpanzees than humans. It wouldn't have even surprised me if they had put their knuckles to the floor and moved with their arms instead of their legs. And it's not just about the way they walked; it's everything. Tatum even had this jutting lower jaw, and it wasn't some fancy prosthetic thing. If he was doing that himself, it must have taken incredible concentration to keep that up through filming. The overall effect, especially with Tatum, was that of cavemen. Or, at least, how we imagine cavemen.And Ruffalo? Well, I wasn't even sure it was him some of the time during the movie. I mean, I thought it was Ruffalo, but, every once in a while, I was doubtful. I thought it was just someone that bore a striking resemblance to him. With the beard and the odd way he moved around, I was never quite sure, not until the credits rolled. That's just impressive.To top it all off, at least as far as I can tell by doing a cursory investigation of what actually happened, the movie got it pretty spot on. The only issue I could even raise is that there is a lack of clarity about the time frame on some of the events, but that doesn't have any actual bearing on the movie or the plot; I was just surprised to find out how far apart some of the events actually were. That's a very small thing for a movie like this.I think this is definitely a movie worth seeing as long as you're not looking for something that's going to give you that feelgood buzz when it's over.

If you want to see this movie, see it before you learn the actual story.]1. Most people (including myself) thought the trailer to this film was kind of vague and hard to remember; you couldn't really tell what it was about. People would say, \"'Foxcatcher'? That's that weird movie about wrestling, right? And Steve Carell sure looks strange.\" But now I understand why. It's almost impossible to summarize the movie.2. The actual plot is easy to explain - two brothers, Dave and Mark Schultz, are Olympic gold medalists in wrestling. The younger one, Mark, is trying to get out of his brother's shadow and become his own person. Mark meets this really strange millionaire, John du Pont, who invites Mark to start a wrestling team on his ranch, and train for the next Olympics. Things don't go as planned.3. The plot is not what the movie is actually about, though. This is a subtle movie where some key points are shown through long, non-verbal scenes, or through short, almost throw-away lines of dialogue. Some people think this movie is too long, quiet, and boring. This means they have not been paying attention, and missed all the important stuff.4. The plot of the movie is basically a true story, but they changed quite a few things to make it fit, and to make the story more complex (there is a lot of controversy over some of the points in the film). The real Mark Schultz has a cameo, as a wrestling official weighing in the movie version of himself.5. I have only one thing to say about Steve Carell. He deserves Best Actor of the Year. And Mark Ruffalo deserves his Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actor.6. Now let me say something about Channing Tatum. The fact that he was not nominated for an Oscar is one of the most mysterious and outrageous snubs I've ever seen. Tatum gives a performance that rivals Carell's. He inhabits his character physically and emotionally. Together, Tatum and Carell turn what could have been a weird little melodrama into a genuine piece of American tragedy.7. There is a constant thread of awkwardness and pain through the movie. It's perfectly matched with the muted, sorrowful colors of the film, the minimalist soundtrack, and the cinematography.8. The movie also sets up a constant, vague sense of unease. You get a feeling in the pit of your stomach that something is going to go very wrong, but you don't know what or when.9. This movie is a quiet, peaceful, psychological car crash, where morals clash with money, \"yes\" clashes with \"no\", family will both support and destroy you, and crushed dreams are painted onto other people. It's open to more than one interpretation, and I don't guarantee that you will like this movie. But I do guarantee that if you can stick with it, it will stick with you.", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[3, 4], :date=>" 2015 January 19", :title=>"Intensely quiet and quietly intense",

It's a quiet film. Slow. Subtle. Almost dreamlike. Much of what happens occurs without dialogue. But there is always a heavy feeling of doom floating over it's sad characters.And what a fascinating bunch of characters. Based on real people, I found myself wondering if a novelist could come up with a trio so laden with emotional and social meaning.John DuPont (Steve Carrell) is the mega millionaire who is vaguely 'off', and clearly fighting mental demons. He dreams of being a wrestling coach and somehow coaching the U.S. to glory, so he essentially buys a now down on his luck ex-champion Mark Shultz (Channing Tatum) to come and wrestle for him. The two men have a complicated and tricky relationship. There is admiration, father and son bonding, resentment and even seemingly unspoken sexual attraction. But neither man is able to communicate about almost any of it, or deal with any of the feelings themselves.The third member of the triumvirate is Shultz's older brother Dave (Mark Rufflao). Less of a painful introvert than his brother, Dave has been Mark's coach and only friend. They have a complex filial relationship, captured beautifully by director Bennett Miller and writers Dan Futterman and E. Max Frye in the lengthy, almost wordless opening scene where Dave leads Mark through a training session. Just as messy, if healthier, than Mark's relationship with DuPont, we see in the scene the love, admiration, jealousy and rivalry that exists between these two quiet men.Now Dave joins Mark at DuPont's vast compound to be 'assistant coach' to DuPont's 'coach', which is deeply bizarre as it quickly becomes clear that Dave knows 10 times as much about both wresting and leadership as DuPont ever will. As we watch a frustrated DuPont quietly head into an ever darker place the tension grows as thick as in a Polanski film, and even the film's conclusion provides little in the way of release. I headed back out into the night with a knot still in my stomach. It's the rare film that can pull me into that kind of claustrophobic space of madness and loss.A word has to be given to the tremendous work done by all three actors, along with Vanessa Redgrave as DuPont's mother -- unforgettable in a role that only gives her a few minutes of screen time. While Carrell has gotten the lion's share of the kudos (and he is terrific, reinventing himself as a purely dramatic actor) both Tatum and Ruffalo also do world class work here, creating inarticulate men who express with their eyes and bodies what they don't quite know how to express with words.This is not a 'fun' movie, but it is one that you can feel deeply, and end up pondering the nature of madness, success, the American dream, class, and family in a way too few recent films lead you to do.", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[2, 3], :date=>" 2015 January 16", :title=>"A deeply chilling and disturbing tone poem of a film", :location=>"", :username=>"K.

Director Bennett Miller's former feature films make him an apt artist to deliver the haunting story of the Schulz brothers and their financial supporter, John E. du Pont. Miller has crafted an unforgettably ominous picture that combines the real life crime genre he chronicled in Capote with the theme of American sports he mastered in Moneyball. The steady stream of subtle foreboding that courses throughout the entirety of Foxcatcher places the film on a trophy shelf of the past decade's other masterworks.In terms of its plot, many of the trailers for Foxcatcher have given away very little as to what the film is actually about. The incident that Miller and screenwriters E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman bring to the screen is the strange but true story of how millionaire du Pont (Steve Carell) ensnared two Gold Medal-winning wrestlers (Channing Tatum & Mark Ruffalo) in his perverted pastiche of patriotism and paranoia. On account of its historical reality, the plot, though intriguing, could be looked up on the internet and revealed to anyone with little fanfare. Miller's chillingly compelling direction ensures that Foxcatcher is first and foremost a psychological film.A fellow critic from Screenrant has criticized Foxcatcher for \"struggling to convey insightful conclusions about its subjects.\" While the film is less than lucid, there is no doubt that any room left for interpretation was a purposeful move from Miller. The film studies its three male leads with a level of focus similar to Paul Thomas Anderson's literary character study The Master. Miller's movie says little explicitly, and leaves ample room for audiences to sift through some disturbing subtext. Throughout the course of Foxcatcher, the viewer sees Mark (Tatum), David (Ruffalo), and even du Pont wrestle on the mat, but the true indications of the character's strengths and weaknesses come through cinematographer Greig Fraser's tormented close-ups. The only thing that these mesmerizing Olympians have trouble grappling with is their inner anguish.There has been a lot of buzz over Steve Carell taking on a dramatic role in Foxcatcher, but skeptics will question whether or not the buzz is justified. Here is the justification: Carell turns in his finest film performance to date as du Pont; the unsettlingly entitled, perplexingly stolid member of America's wealthiest family who has more than his fair share of, shall we say, eccentricities. While the buzz is certainly well-deserved, it turns out that du Pont has much more in common with Carell's signature Dunder-Mifflin manager Michael Scott than one might think. Like Michael, all Du Pont seems to want is love and admiration; validation from human beings who genuinely care for him. However, as infuriating as Michael Scott could be, it is more than safe to say that du Pont proves to be a bigger nightmare of a boss. Carell's understated work in the film elicits gripping fascination from the audience; it is the kind of comedian-turned-dramatist performance that would make the late Robin Williams beam with pride.Beyond Carell's performance, there is much more to commend in Miller's third feature. Tatum and Ruffalo also turn in career high-point performances. Tatum acts against type as an aloof and stand-offish champion, while Ruffalo portrays the picture's most headstrong character: a family man becoming progressively aware of the strings du Pont has attached to everyone he ropes into his estate. Audiences going to Foxcatcher expecting the next Chariots of Fire or Miracle will be sorely disappointed - viewers should not even approach the movie expecting to learn anything about wrestling itself. One critic from Tolucan Times complains that \"it doesn't explain a thing about Olympic wrestling.\" This criticism is invalid. Although there is nothing wrong with being a sports movie, wrestling is virtually irrelevant to the Foxcatcher's real concerns. The filmmakers have turned torpid tabloid fodder into rumination about the all too thin veil of delusion separating the wealthy from the poor, the strong from the weak, and the American from the American Dream.Grade: ABy Ben Pieper (November 30th, 2014)", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[4, 6], :date=>" 2014 December 29", :title=>"Wrestling with the American Dream", :location=>"", :username=>"Ben Pieper", :source=>{:vendor=>"amazon", :url=>"http://www.amazon.com/Foxcatcher-Steve-Carell/product-reviews/B00R2LU906"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"If Stanley Kubrick had ever gotten around to making a sports movie, it would look and feel a lot like Foxcatcher.", :clean_text=>"if stanley kubrick had ever gotten around to making a sports movie it would look and feel a lot like foxcatcher", :sentiment=>{:average=>-0.0725, :corrected_average=>-0.12, :scores=>[0.2, 0.0, -0.3, -0.19], :total=>-0.29}, :context_tags=>{}, :context_indexes=>{}, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[], :emphasis=>0.19}, {:index=>1, :text=>"Director Bennett Miller's former feature films make him an apt artist to deliver the haunting story of the Schulz brothers and their financial supporter, John E. du Pont.", :clean_text=>"director bennett millers former feature films make him an apt artist to deliver the haunting  of the schulz brothers and their financial supporter john e du pont", :sentiment=>{:average=>0.27625, :corrected_average=>0.13, :scores=>[0.2, 0.14, 0.195, 0.57], :total=>1.105}, :context_tags=>{:plot=>["story"]}, :context_indexes=>{"story"=>[93]}, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[], :emphasis=>0.25}, {:index=>2, :text=>"Miller has crafted an unforgettably ominous picture that combines the real life crime genre he chronicled in Capote with the theme of American sports he mastered in Moneyball.", :clean_text=>"miller has crafted an unforgettably ominous picture that combines the real life crime genre he chronicled in capote with the theme of american sports he mastered in moneyball", :sentiment=>{:average=>-0.0825, :corrected_average=>0.08, :scores=>[0.0, 0.28, -0.655, 0.045], :total=>-0.33}, :context_tags=>{}, :context_indexes=>{}, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[], :emphasis=>0.14}, {:index=>3, :text=>"The steady stream of subtle foreboding that courses throughout the entirety of Foxcatcher places the film on a trophy shelf of the past decade's other masterworks.In terms of its plot, many of the trailers for Foxcatcher have given away very little as to what the film is actually about.", :clean_text=>"the steady stream of subtle foreboding that courses throughout the entirety of foxcatcher places the film on a shelf of the past decades other masterworksin terms of its  many of the trailers for foxcatcher have given away very little as to what the film is actually about", :sentiment=>{:average=>-0.40875, :corrected_average=>-0.2, :scores=>[0.0, -0.83, -0.745, -0.06], :total=>-1.635}, :context_tags=>{:plot=>["plot"]}, :context_indexes=>{"plot"=>[170]}, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[], :emphasis=>0.1}, {:index=>4, :text=>"The incident that Miller and screenwriters E.

Rothman (jasonrothman@yahoo.com)", :location=>"from Philadelphia, PA", :date=>"14 November 2014", :content=>"\nThe saga of John du Pont is one of the more bizarre and tragic stories\nfrom the mid-1990s. In Bennett Miller's dark and ominous Foxcatcher,\nthe episode is framed as a true-life Faustian Tale. But the story is\nalmost secondary to three outstanding dramatic performances -- two of\nwhich are given by men who are better known for their work in other\ngenres.Channing Tatum stars as Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz. When we first\nmeet him, he's already reached elite status by winning a gold medal.\nBut the achievement hasn't allowed him to escape the shadow of his\nolder brother, Dave, also a gold medalist. The younger Schultz wants\nmore. He wants to be the best. His past prize also doesn't pay the\nbills. After training sessions, he's eating ramen noodles. All that\nchanges, however, with a phone call from du Pont (Steve Carell) who\noffers to pay him and set him up in a first-class training facility on\nhis Pennsylvania estate.Like Schultz, the multi-millionaire du Pont is a man in a seemingly\nenviable position who nevertheless wants something greater. He has\nfamily issues of his own, as he strives to please his disapproving\nmother (Vanessa Redgrave). He hopes he can make her proud by leading a\nteam of wrestlers to gold in Seoul in 1988. But du Pont doesn't just\nwant to be a benefactor. Even though he's little more than an extremely\nwealthy fan, with only a rudimentary knowledge of the sport, he wants\nto be seen as a coach and mentor to his wrestlers. And so, when Dave\narrives to guide his brother, jealousy develops. Dave is everything du\nPont wishes he could be, but isn't. He's a great teacher, a great\nleader. This leads to tension that slowly builds toward the story's\nshocking climax as du Pont's demons emerge.As du Pont, Carell is almost unrecognizable beneath make-up and\nprosthetics. It's a quietly disturbing performance that will definitely\nhave audiences and critics seeing the comic talent in a new light.\nAction/comedy star Tatum also has a breakthrough turn as the intense\nand driven young Schultz who grows increasingly uncomfortable under du\nPont's subjugation. As a past Academy Award nominee, Mark Ruffalo's\nexceptional portrayal of the older Schultz comes as less of a surprise.\nBut that doesn't make it any less notable or transformative. The\nnormally wiry Ruffalo packed on a lot of muscle to play Dave Schultz.\nHere, he looks less like his Bruce Banner alter ego, and more like the\nHulk himself. All three performances are a study in the art of subtly.\nThis is a movie that derives drama from silent moments. In many key\nscenes, it's the words that aren't said that speak volumes.Foxcatcher features themes of control and manipulation, and wrestling\nfunctions as an apt metaphor. It's that most primal of sports \u0096 one in\nwhich you literally bend another person to your will. Ultimately\nthough, the movie is a story about two people who reach for greatness,\nonly to experience a great fall. And it's also the tale of a great man\ncaught in the middle. The saddest part is that it actually happened.\n*** This review may contain spoilers ****** This review may contain spoilers ****** This review may contain spoilers ****** This review may contain

Directed by Bennett Miller, Foxcatcher taps\ninto the psychology behind Du Pont, examining his psyche in the most\ndisturbing of fashions. Steve Carrel delivers a performance that many\nwill find hard to swallow. He is dry, he is awkward, and he is\ncompletely insane. To keep it simple, Steve Carrel is absolutely\nterrific and truly shows his range as an actor. It is an amazing\nperformance that is bound for Oscar glory. The other half to Carrel's\nDu Pont is Channing Tatum as Mark Schultz. Tatum completely drowns into\nhis character, leading him to turn in a vicious, unapologetic\nperformance that is so perfectly executed that you will soon forget\nthat this is Channing Tatum. When he is on screen, he is Mark Schultz.\nIt is the best performance that Tatum has given in his career and\nstands to grab a possible Best Suppoting Actor nod at this year's\nOscars. The voice of reason for both Mark and Du Pont lies in Dave\nSchultz, played brilliantly by Mark Ruffalo. Dave serves as this\nmediator in between Mark and Du Pont especially when their relationship\nstarts becoming more and more intense and violent. The rest of the cast\nfeaturing Vannessa Redgrave and Anthony Michael Hall also turn in very\nsound and great performances as well. As far as acting is concerned,\nFoxcatcher is a hard film to beat. Every actor is on top of their game\nhere and it really shows how good of a director Bennet Miller is. He\ntakes a seemingly dry script and turns it into an emotional\nroller-coaster by way of his actors. One scene in particular haunted me\ninvolving a simple glare from Tatum's Mark Schultz as he peddles faster\nand harder upon seeing Du Pont. That scene on paper isn't that\ninteresting but with Miller's uncanny ability to make even the simplest\nscenes intricate and layered, it works and remains one of the more\nmemorable scenes from the film. The other highlight from this film has\nto be the cinematography. Everything is filmed with a slight tint of\ndread and gray, it creates the mood immediately and balances the story\nperfectly.

:location=>"from IL, USA", :date=>"27 November 2014", :content=>"\n\"Foxcatcher\" is anything but a wrestling drama. Although based on the\ntrue story of Olympic gold medalist Mark Schultz and his brief years of\ntraining under multi-millionaire John du Pont, \"Foxcatcher\" expands\nwell beyond the wrestling ring into the minds of two men longing to\nfind greatness.So those expecting anything close to director Bennett Miller's last\nfilm, \"Moneyball,\" should be forewarned. This is not a sports movie,\nbut a slow-burning character study (like Miller's first acclaimed film,\n\"Capote\") in which the wrestling serves as the visual, physical\nexpression of the psychological struggle between the characters.When we first meet Mark, played by Channing Tatum, whose versatility\ncontinues to amaze, it's 1987 and he is living in the faded glory of\nhis 1984 gold medal. Despite his success, he is living a rather lonely\nlife and itching to accomplish more; his brother, Dave (Mark Ruffalo),\nalso won gold and Dave feels that leaves him with something to prove.\nSo when John du Pont (Steve Carell) contacts him about paying him to\ncome train at his top-notch facility on his family's estate, Foxcatcher\nFarm, he sees his opportunity.Mark and du Pont's philosophies about striving to be the best align,\nand the two form a close, almost father-and-son bond, though more so\nbecause they both feel pressure to live up to others' expectations. Du\nPont, in particular, wants to prove himself to his mother (Vanessa\nRedgrave), who breeds world class horses and finds wrestling barbaric.\nJohn's desperation, bottomless checkbook and unresolved family issues\nmake for a dangerous combination, and his relationship with Mark slowly\nbegins to change for the worse. Further complicating the matter is\nDave, the only man capable of saving Mark from his demanding\nexpectations of himself and whose coaching expertise intimidates du\nPont.The often unspoken psychological warfare between the three (and,\nperhaps most importantly, du Pont and his mother) is the driving force\nof the story more than anything that actually happens on screen. Mark's\nups and downs as he competes at the '87 World Championships and '88\nOlympic trials are symptomatic of his mental state and the state of his\nrelationship with the other men. As such, \"Foxcatcher\" is a long, at\ntimes brooding film that can drag in spite of the brilliant character\ndevelopment and internal drama.E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman's script is quiet and doesn't have a lot\nof big juicy moments for its actors to lean on, so the fact that Carell\nis totally haunting and captivating in this role says a lot. Du Pont is\nan incredibly complex character whose back story is mostly implied so\nas to keep him as unpredictable as possible. Even with all the makeup\non, Carell gives the epitome of an understated performance, something\nyou would never dream possible from a guy who has made a career out of\nbig acting and abrasive characters. Undoubtedly some credit goes to\nMiller, who has churned out acting nominations and wins for his\nprevious casts, and gets Carell and Tatum to pause and linger at all\nthe right moments.With those two in transforming roles, it's easy to overlook Ruffalo\n(who always seems to get overlooked). Dave is the comparison point for\nboth these men. He's a family man who is smart, has accomplished a lot\nand knows what it truly means to work hard. Ruffalo brings his\ntrademark authenticity to his part as the \"good guy\" and does it so\nwell.Even when it's too quiet and languishes, \"Foxcatcher\" is a fine piece\nof cinema and Miller has established himself as a true auteur. It\ncertainly does not satisfy in the mainstream sense, but its purposeful\nuse of imagery, total avoidance of melodrama and magnifying glass on\nthe human condition make it an undeniably sharp and intelligent art\nfilm to be sure.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

be hot at\nthe Oscars thanks to huge departures from typecasting for both Carrell\n& Tatum. \"Accuracy of events and characterizations be damned - we're making an\nart movie here!\" Let's summarize, shall we? Forrest Gump and his bearded brother,\nQuasimodo, both won wrestling gold in the 84 Olympics. Their\nrelationship is somewhat strained, as Forrest feels second best. 1987,\nwe see Forrest poor and down on his luck, when mentally disturbed\nnarcissist, billionaire & self-appointed ace wrestling coach,\nMontgomery Burns, invites Forrest over to his elaborate estate to\nwrestle for him and assist in coaching his team in exchange for\nboarding and big money. Forrest wins gold at the 87 World\nchampionships, and fosters a twisted father/son relationship with Mr\nBurns. Much homo-erotic bonding, drinking and drug use later, Mr Burns loses\nhis marbles, humiliates Forrest (who is now addicted to booze and\ncocaine), and instead brings in Quasimodo as assistant coach, reducing\nForrest to wrestler status. Forrest cracks under the pressure, and\nsucks at the 88 Olympics. Mr Burns grows envious of Quasimodo's\ncoaching prowess and success, as well as his efforts to protect\nForrest, regardless of poor performance. Forrest gets the boot & takes\nup cage fighting, while Quasimodo stays behind and eventually gets\nmurdered by a slow-burning, envious Mr Burns.Channing Tatum plays Mark Schulz, aka Forrest Gump - minus the good\nhumor and sunny disposition... instead replaced by an\noverly-accentuated ape-walk and a constantly protruding forced\nunder-bite that obviously made it hard to speak. A shame that he had to\nbe portrayed in a mentally challenged, quasi-autistic fashion, when the\nactual Mark Schulz is in fact a personable guy that had a 3.6 GPA in\nhigh school.Mark Ruffalo is Dave Schulz, aka Quasimodo - having packed on a few\npounds of muscle and managing to look exactly like David Cross, our\ntragic hero is always hunched over and bow-legged, in a\nmorning-after-Brokeback-Mountain kind of way.And finally, funny man Steve Carrell... John DuPont - who is portrayed\nas Mr Burns with a speech impediment, an unhealthy love for guns, and a\nthousand-yard-stare borne of the constant clamoring for his\naristocratic mother's affections & approval. His over-accentuated giant\nnose sadly changes size and shape several times throughout the film.Everyone else is just a face - added like an afterthought, with no real\ninteractions or discussions with the main characters.It's got the whole \"Faustian retelling, filled with belated guilted\npatriotism for a fallen American sports champion\" vibe about it - throw\nin some men grappling, oddly shot scenes, men hugging, incredibly slow\ndialog, men slapping each other's backs and shoulders and a score\nfilled with loads of melancholic piano during dramatic shots, and it's\neasy to see how it was so loved by the Cannes crowd...Personally though, I wanted to gouge out my eyes halfway through - the\nfilm could have been around 40 minutes shorter were it not for the\ndramatic artsy landscape / filmed through a window / mundane happenings\nscenes and the frustratingly slow dialog.The most entertaining bit during the entire 2-hour ordeal, was having a\nchuckle at the snoring of the guy sitting behind me.I went in expecting an epic sports drama of Warrior proportions, and\nleft depressed, wondering where it all went wrong.Avoid this film like the plague.\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1100089/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"\nFoxcatcher... a limp train wreck of a film, driven only by the tragedy\nof the true story on which it's based, and no doubt geared to be hot at\nthe Oscars thanks to huge departures from typecasting for both Carrell\n& Tatum.", :clean_text=>"foxcatcher a limp train wreck of a film driven only by the tragedy of the true  on which its based and no doubt geared to be hot at the oscars thanks to huge departures from typecasting for both carrell tatum", :sentiment=>{:average=>-0.6799999999999999, :corrected_average=>-0.21, :scores=>[-0.1, -0.25, -1.89, -0.48], :total=>-2.7199999999999998}, :context_tags=>{:plot=>["story"]}, :context_indexes=>{"story"=>[79]}, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[], :emphasis=>0.1}, {:index=>1, :text=>"\"Accuracy of events and characterizations be damned -

The\nfilm is based on the autobiography of Olympic Wrestling Champion Mark\nSchultz where he details his training leading up to the 1988 Olympics.John Du Pont decides he wants to coach the men's Olympic Wrestling\nteam. What are his qualifications you are asking yourself in the\nmeantime? None. He has no qualifications. He simply is a rich\nschizophrenic man who lives at home with his mother and has a very\nstrange affection toward men's wrestling and especially Mark Schultz.\nThe film provides a dark tone and setting for the entirety of the film\noffering no alternative. The story is dark and Miller makes sure you\nknow that.The film is based on real events so it is not a spoiler to tell you\nthat Du Pont's schizophrenia leads to a murder resulting him in jail\nwhere he resided until his death in 2010. His obsession with Mark and\nhis brother Dave Schultz, another Olympic gold medalist, becomes the\ncenter of the plot in this spine tingling tale.Steve Carell is going to get an Oscar nomination for this. He has\nfinally proved to audiences that he can undertake and perfect dramatic\nacting. There is not one specific scene in the film that showcases this\ntalent rather his performance as a whole. He is John Du Pont. They\nplaster on him a fake nose, make him look much older, and voil you\nhave Steve Carell looking like Du Pont. Next, he masterfully had to act\nlike Du Pont. His struggle to prove to his mother he can do something\nand his sickening obsession with Mark and Dave give us that eerie\nfeeling he is up to no good. Steve Carell freaked me out in this film.\nIf it were up to me, I would absolutely give him a nomination and\nprobably the Oscar.Channing Tatum gives the biggest and best breakthrough performance I\nhave ever seen. This role is not like any others for Tatum. He plays\nMark Schultz, the younger of the two brothers. Tatum perfects Schultz's\nnervous habits allowing the audience to see the insecurity in Schultz's\nmind. He is a loner, seemingly sexually confused, and very much\ninsecure about his own wrestling ability despite being an Olympic\nChampion. Channing Tatum is magnificent. I pray he receives an Oscar\nnomination as well.It is so refreshing to see actors who have never really branched out\nbefore finally show us what they got. Tatum branched out with\nFoxcatcher and he showed us he has what it takes to be a serious actor\nand potential Oscar nominee in the future.Director Bennett Miller won the Best Director prize at this year's\nCannes Film Festival and I must confess I admire his directing so much.\nFoxcatcher is a very well made film and is created quite tastefully.\nThere are several scenes that allude to Du Pont's homosexuality with\nhis complete infatuation with Mark towards the beginning. It even\nimplies Mark allowed this to evolve into something. Whatever it is,\nMiller does an excellent job conveying the creepiness of it all. His\nprevious filmography includes Capote (2005) and Moneyball (2011).\nObviously Miller enjoys creating stories centered on real people and\nevents.This film is not lighthearted and happy. It is dark and it is\nmysterious. Miller keeps us in a sort of shrouded mist throughout the\nfilm. It is very ambiguous at times but this ambiguity does not inhibit\nthe film at all. This was one of the best films I saw at Cannes this\nyear and I believe it's going to rack up a lot of Oscar nominations\nthis awards season.\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb",

A movie I didn't expect much from, but it was in\nfact one of the best movies of 2014.

This is not a movie about the good\nside of the sport, it's about the bad one we don't get to see when Hulk\nMania and The Rock performs nowadays.The film is based upon a true story. Mark Schultz is an Olympic\nwrestler. His relationship with his sponsor, John du Pont and his older\nbrother leads to very unlikely circumstances between both. John du Pont\nturns out to be a bit different than the man he first seemed like.What I first wondered when I read about the film was, \"how could they\npick Channing Tatum for such a dramatic role? Isn't he that guy who\njust shows off his abs so the girls can look at something?\" Well, in\nthis movie Channing was someone completely different. He is superb as\nMark Schultz, I couldn't imagine anyone else playing him after seeing\nthis film. And this is partly what makes the film very watchable and\ngood. Steve Carell (who usually stars in sex comedies) also did an\namazing job as John du Pont. I could barely recognize him at first, and\nforgot that it was him 10 minutes after he first appeared on the\nscreen. In the end, I also forgot what he looks like in real life.\nGreat job on the make up there!The good performances is definitely what I enjoyed the most. I'm not\ninto wrestling, and Foxcatcher didn't really make me interested. It's a\nvery deterrent example of how some Olympic athletes are trained and\ntreated when they're not on TV. The movie will be out in theaters later\nthis month, and I suggest you to go watch it. If you're not a fan of\nwrestling, that's even better. I don't like the sport but loved this\nmovie.However, pick your theater carefully. Sadly, some people in front of me\nwaited to see Channing Tatum naked during the beginning. They were just\nannoying, but quiet when they realized that they weren't watching a\nteen comedy. Which was, around thirty minutes into the film. So I\ndidn't really mind!

Seated firmly in the\ncenter are a trio of dazzling performances from Channing Tatum, Steve\nCarell, and Mark Ruffalo, all of which make a compelling case for their\ncareer best works.Written by Oscar-nominee Dan Futterman and E. Max Frye, \"Foxcatcher\"\ntells the story of Mark Schultz (Tatum), an Olympic wrestler who\nbefriends billionaire John Du Pont (Carell) in the mid-1980's. Along\nwith his brother Dave (Ruffalo) and his wife Nancy (Sienna Miller),\nthat new relationship leads to unforeseen consequences.At the core of this morality tale is Bennett Miller, the Oscar-\nnominated director of \"Capote\" and \"Moneyball.\" He allows\"Foxcatcher\"\nto study its subjects, and give the audience an in-depth understanding\nof all the motives involved. With the help of Cinematographer Greig\nFraser, and composer Rob Simonsen, the movie's melancholy atmosphere is\ntruly compelling. Miller's brilliance isn't in things he chooses to\nshow, but in the things he chooses not to. He draws out scenes that\noffer so much to the narrative. There's still so much left on the table\nthat we do not know, which in itself, is perfectly acceptable. Life\nnever gives us all the answers we seek. Miller, Futterman, and Frye\nunderstand this. Material like this calls to be made into a film. I'm\nso glad that these three answered the call.What Steve Carell achieves as John DuPont is not just a performance by\na full embodiment. With strength and precision, he understands DuPont,\na man with an extreme outlook on reality. Carell doesn't just ask us to\nsympathize with John, between his awkward behavior and his constant\nyearning to impress his family's legacy, he demands our understanding.\nIf I didn't already know about the film for the past two years, I\nwouldn't have recognized him. His performance is completely focused and\nprofound. Looking at the way he carries himself through the film, you\nare witnessing one of the purest creations of a character this year.\nWhen he's not on-screen, you're secretly wishing he was.When it comes to Channing Tatum, I have to admit that I never FULLY\nunderstood the appeal. Discovered the young ferocious actor in Dito\nMontiel's \"A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints\" nearly a decade ago, and\nafterwards was only mildly entertained by his presence in films like\n\"21 Jump Street\" and \"Side Effects.\" What he does in Miller's film is\nsomething beyond anything I could have ever thought he could do. Tatum\ndoesn't just do an imitation, he channels the inner workings of a man\ndesperate for more. His peculiarities are richly on display as he\nyearns for a father figure outside of the shadow of his more successful\nbrother. He embraces the odd DuPont, against all logical instincts, but\nyou can see exactly why he would feel so compelled to do so. Mark Ruffalo gives Dave the ticks and beats of an original creation.\nPicking at his beard (something I know all too well), constantly\nengaging in team leadership, and hugging his younger brother whose more\nof a son than anything. Ruffalo mounts himself on the perch of a loving\nbrother just trying to create success for himself and his family. This\nis another solid outing for him. Co-star Vanessa Redgrave, as John's fragile mother, is marvelous in her\nshort scenes while Sienna Miller adds a needed dynamic to understanding\nboth Mark and Dave. The two women both offer compassion and balance.\"Foxcatcher\" is terrifying, disturbing, and utterly engaging. A slowly\nunraveled piece that is risky but pays off immensely. It's cautious yet\nstrictly well-defined as a character study. Like all great films with\ngreat performances, its element of truth is plainly apparent. On the\ngray-skied farm, we will get to know three interesting men, some of\nwhich, we'll never truly understand.\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1100089/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"\nA film that takes its time presenting its case, Bennett Miller's\nwickedly brutal \"Foxcatcher\" entices audiences to learn more about the\nquestions around us, and where they could lead.", :clean_text=>"a film that takes its time presenting its case bennett millers wickedly brutal foxcatcher entices audiences to learn more about the questions around us and where they could lead", :sentiment=>{:average=>-0.09499999999999999, :corrected_average=>0.11, :scores=>[0.0, -0.83, 0.45, 0.0], :total=>-0.37999999999999995}, :context_tags=>{}, :context_indexes=>{}, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[], :emphasis=>0.17}, {:index=>1, :text=>"Seated firmly in the\ncenter are a trio of dazzling performances from Channing Tatum, Steve\nCarell, and Mark Ruffalo, all of which make a compelling case for their\ncareer best works.Written by Oscar-nominee Dan Futterman and E.

Mark (Channing Tatum) and Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo), as he hopes to lead the Olympic wrestling team back to glory in the 1988 Seoul Games even though du Pont shows clear signs of paranoia and insanity that threatens not only his vision, but his wrestlers' personal safety as well.

Bennett Miller proves to once again he is a director to be reckoned with.  Each silent scene blissfully and steadily moved into the next, making me pay close attention to every detail.  Steve Carell gives a career-defining performance as John du Pont, the wealthy schizophrenic who decided to train wrestlers and took the Schultz brothers under his wing.  Carell delivers us a man who is truly a despicable embodiment of terror.  He is a living nightmare, one whose face has haunted my dreams and has given me an entirely new view on wealth, evil, and dominance.  Few comedians can take such a different turn into dark dramatic territory, but not only does Carell pass with flying colors, he has delivered what may be the best acting performance I have seen this year.  We never fully understand the man's intentions, his process, all we know is that we are witnessing a deeply disturbed human being that truly captivates the screen.  Channing Tatum delivers easily his best performance to date as Mark Schultz, its a performance that took all his physical and mental strength to perfect.  He is like a hopeless ape trying to be the best in the world, and his dynamic with Carell and Ruffolo was some of his best moments.  Watching his silently tormented expressions was incredibly captivating, as we see his passion to not fail and du Pont's influence take a toll on him.  Mark Ruffolo is breathtaking as Dave Schultz, Mark's older and more experienced brother.  His sympathetic and concerned performance came out of nowhere, as the beginning of the film focuses on Mark but we slowly see Dave as the one who truly loves his brother and wants to help him any way he can.  He doesn't quite match Carell and Tatum with their immersive performances that gave us something we had never seen from either of them, but Ruffolo certainly is great enough to be worthy of his award nods.  Bennett Miller only creates a film if he truly believes in its story and its protagonist, as we saw with Billy Beane in Moneyball or Truman Capote in Capote.  But this is the other side of the coin, instead of those inspiring men we get a demented, cruel, and terrifying monster in John du Pont.  I read about the production of this film over a year ago when I heard about the stunning and cast and director, so I won't lie in saying I was very excited for this film.  I studied John du Pont and his life and all I can say is that Miller and Carell truly brought this monster to life flawlessly.  Its a story about power, wealth, dominance, evil, the obsession and lengths we go to not fail and be the best, the relationship between a coach and his pupil, and the dark descent into madness.  Most would agree its not a film for everyone, its a movie that slowly builds the tension and develops its characters so that we may have a focused and epic tale.  Thats right, I said epic.  Foxcatcher brings us another Bennett Miller masterpiece, with a script that grasps and torments its audience with the uncomfortable feeling we get from the situations at play.  Its the performances that will leave people talking for days to come, with each of them bringing what may arguably be the best performances of their careers.  But its Steve Carell that left me completely speechless by bringing us a monster and performance that will be mentioned for years to come.  Foxcatcher is the best film of the year because no film stayed in my mind and haunted my psychosis like this, its truly a work of cinematic art.", :title=>nil, :location=>nil,

:rating=>2.5, :percentage=>40.0, :content=>"YOU CAN CATCH THIS FOX, IT AIN'T MOVING SO FAST - My Review of FOXCATCH (2  1/2 Stars)Chilly, fascinating, and wonderfully acted,  FOXCATCHER wants to be that zeitgeist/capture the spirit of America watercooler film, but suffers from  a turgid pace and a bad case of all subtext and no text.  Based on the true story of John du Pont (Steve Carell), the millionaire who decided to sponsor a wrestling team in the late 80s in order to secure Olympic gold medals, an effort that goes horribly wrong.  He brings Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), a medalist who has reached the \"eating ramen\" stage of his post-glory career, to his Pennsylvania estate and establishes the USA Wrestling Team.  The friendship between Schultz and du Pont and its unusual, complicated dynamics are the main focus of E. Maxe Fry and Dan Futterman's screenplay and Bennett Miller's direction.  Du Pont instills himself as a father figure to Schultz, a classic \"big galoot\" in the ROCKY vein.  Complicating matters is the fact that Schultz has a big brother, Dave (Mark Ruffalo), who already fills that role, creating tension between du Pont and the brothers.  Dave is also an Olympic wrestler, and he grows suspicious of du Pont's methods of luring young men into a world of private jets, drugs, free room and board and incompetent wrestling advice.  Carell is fantastic, nailing the regional accent and the removed air of entitlement almost exclusive to heirs to fortunes.  There's nothing charming about this sociopath.  He sucks the air out of any room he enters, and Carell's uptight posture and inability to truly connect with another human being is the centerpiece of this film's creepiness.  There's greatness here, and some moments, such as his conversation with his disapproving mother (Vanessa Redgrave) deliver on the unspoken judgment of du Ponts homoerotic machinations.  In fact, the entire movie is an exploration of hidden desires, and this is a work so immersed in looks, glances, and desperation, that somewhere along the way, they forgot to provide much context.  Some will say that this is a film that respects the audience's intelligence by not spelling everything out.  Personally, I would have liked to have known more about the characters.  As it is, we get a bizarre gay love triangle with no real ballast.  The film feels way longer that it is as things just don't seem to move along.  It's clearly intentional, but without knowing too much about anyone or anything, it's skin deep despite its layered, rich subject matter.  This is a story which should hurtle like a fox towards its inevitable conclusion, but it moves like a turtle.  Yet, yet, yet, this is a work not to be dismissed.  Cinematographer, Greig Fraser (ZERO DARK THIRTY, LET ME IN) is a master of mood.  You can almost feel the cold temperatures on display.  Bennett Miller does a fine job of circling around his characters and dispassionately observing their decay.  His MONEYBALL had a snappy pace, but FOXCATCHER is closer is tone to CAPOTE, which wallowed in sorrow.  I admire what the filmmakers were going for, but I can't say I loved watching it.  The performances, however, are stellar.  In addition to Carell, Tatum does his best work yet, nailing the hulking walk and hairtrigger moods of a man who slowly (VERY SLOWLY) comes to the realization that he's being used in a rich man's sado-masochistic games.  An almost wordless performance, Tatum is captivating and soul-crushing.  The scenes in which he has 90 minutes to lose 12 pounds are the few moments where this film truly crackles.  Ruffalo transforms himself into a fireplug of a guy.  There isn't a whole lot for him to do here, and even less for Sienna Miller to do as his wife, but what he does is bring a sense of normalcy to an intensely abnormal situation.The leering at the dirty old man with his wedgie gym shorts and AMBIGUOUSLY GAY DUO-esque wrestling demonstrations left a bad taste in my mouth.  Because we aren't given much context for his behavior, he's one wide stance away from being a politician hanging out in an airport bathroom!  Still, thinks get so odd and tragic that I have to recommend this film.  It's singular and has stuck with me...and that's something to celebrate, even though it's often boring as hell.", :title=>nil, :location=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"rotten_tomatoes", :url=>"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/foxcatcher/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"YOU CAN CATCH THIS FOX, IT AIN'T MOVING SO FAST - My Review of FOXCATCH (2  1/2 Stars)Chilly, fascinating, and wonderfully acted,  FOXCATCHER wants to be that zeitgeist/capture the spirit of America watercooler film, but suffers from  a turgid pace and a bad case of all subtext and no text.", :clean_text=>"you can catch this fox it aint moving so fast my review of foxcatch starschilly fascinating and wonderfully acted foxcatcher wants to be that zeitgeistcapture the spirit of america watercooler film but suffers from a turgid pace and a bad case of all subtext and no text", :sentiment=>{:average=>-0.32625, :corrected_average=>-0.06, :scores=>[-0.2, 0.0, -1.065, -0.04], :total=>-1.305}, :context_tags=>{}, :context_indexes=>{}, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[], :emphasis=>0.32}, {:index=>1, :text=>"Based on the true story of John du Pont (Steve Carell), the millionaire who decided to sponsor a wrestling team in the late 80s in order to secure Olympic gold medals, an effort that goes horribly wrong.", :clean_text=>"based on the true  of john du pont steve carell the millionaire who decided to sponsor a wrestling team in the late s in order to secure olympic gold medals an effort that goes horribly wrong", :sentiment=>{:average=>-0.29375, :corrected_average=>0.07, :scores=>[0.2, 0.0, -1.44, 0.065], :total=>-1.175}, :context_tags=>{:plot=>["story"]}, :context_indexes=>{"story"=>[18]}, :people_tags=>["Steve Carell"], :people_indexes=>[["Steve Carell", [[41]]]], :emphasis=>0.16}, {:index=>2, :text=>"He brings Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), a medalist who has reached the \"eating ramen\" stage of his post-glory career, to his Pennsylvania estate and establishes the USA Wrestling Team.", :clean_text=>"he brings mark schultz channing tatum a medalist who has reached the eating ramen stage of his postglory career to his pennsylvania estate and establishes the usa wrestling team", :sentiment=>{:average=>-0.045000000000000005, :corrected_average=>0.03, :scores=>[0.1, 0.0, -0.28, 0.0], :total=>-0.18000000000000002}, :context_tags=>{}, :context_indexes=>{}, :people_tags=>["Channing Tatum"], :people_indexes=>[["Channing Tatum", [[24]]]], :emphasis=>0.31}, {:index=>3, :text=>"The friendship between Schultz and du Pont and its unusual, complicated dynamics are the main focus of E.

Yeah, sometimes I actually look forward to a slow-paced, pretentious drama focused on three characters.  I'm weird like that.  Foxcatcher benefits immensely from this micro-focus and is honestly the paradigm of what you can do with three dedicated actors and a script that allows them to breathe.  If I had to describe the feel or tone it would be cold and detached.  We see characters interact with one another but little judgment is passed by the camera.  In other words, we aren't told how we are supposed to feel.  Steve Carell shows his dramatic chops here as creepy, self-absorbed predator John du Pont, whose seemingly benevolent interest in coaching American Olympic Wrestling is implied to have more to do with his Oedipus complex with his aging, cold mother and possible closeted homosexuality.  All this he covers by brandishing the American flag with odd speeches and manipulates the main character with money, cocaine, fraternal jealousy, and Reagan-era jingoism.  I was always of the opinion that Carell could play an unnerving villain and it's an avenue he might want to explore further given his success here.  Mark Ruffalo plays the most relatable character and he impresses even if the sword of Damocles clearly hangs above his head in the few scenes that he is present.  And Channing Tatum holds his own, displaying great emotional range and has the only arc of the movie.  His dialogue exchanges with Carell comprise the bulk of the film and it is through these we learn just how na칦ve our protagonist is and how completely removed from humanity du Pont is.  It's also important to note that the wrestling scenes, whether they are practice or a competition are well filmed and realistic affairs, showing the physical strain and the preparation these athletes undergo.  That this was all based on a true story may surprise you, although Foxcatcher takes a fair amount of creative license in a similar manner to The Imitation Game, Selma, The Theory of Everything, and American Sniper.

Even though the sad sack blue collar characters prove relatable and elicit great sympathy, the pervasive funereal tone makes the viewer feel uncomfortable, just waiting for some proverbial hammer to drop. This move was intentional, however, doling out a straight forward albeit odd true crime story that plays out as an arresting psychological drama. So unsettling at times, Foxcatcher's easy to appreciate but hard to embrace.In this R-rated drama based on the true story of Mark Schultz, an Olympic wrestler (Tatum) sponsored by millionaire John du Pont (Carell) finds his life leading to unlikely circumstances. Like it was his mutant X-Man power, Bennett Miller evinces an ability to capture both the posh upper class and a mundane near-broke existence with a gentle grandiosity, framing life in a perpetual funeral dirge that sadly seems less pessimistic than resolutely fatalistic. This style came more into play during the maudlin character study Capote as opposed to the sporty adaptation Moneyball. Always surprising whether in blockbuster actioners, raunchy comedies, and romantic dramas alike, Channing Tatum wows audiences here with a limited amount of dialogue and an arsenal of mercurial expressions. His melancholic wrestler stands in deference to his easy going good-natured brother, a tragic figure brilliantly played by Mark Ruffalo. As for Steve Carell, going against type and almost unrecognizable under prosthetics, there's that old adage: Never let them catch you acting. He gets points for going full bizarro but, as a filmgoer - perhaps because his performance and subject proves so oft kilter - you sometimes start to think that you're watching him act.

It simply did not provide the necessary spark to grab the viewers attention in my mind, but regardless, its importance is clear. Other than that, while typically top-notch, the CGI at times was noticeable with some unrealistic deaths along the way, but that is to be expected, as no film is perfect.

However, its appeal and publicity doesn't always match what the actual film delivers, yes this is a story about revenge, the journey of a man who was on the brink of release from the Roman army, a man who won the honour and glory of his fellow soldiers, who battled and won every fight, who was admired by the great, Marcus Aurelius himself. Only too lose everything he holds dear and to be embroiled into gladiator games where he fights to the death and slowly regains his pride and honour to exact revenge on the man who took it all away from him. sound interesting? sure it does do this, but at a cost of being weighed down in political hoohaar and character arks that never really go anywhere until the end (which might I add is probably one of the best directed,acted and moving ending 30 minutes of this century, as of to date) but all that information and back story seems to be lost, the characters that side with Maximus seem to suddenly loose there morals and make an alarmingly unbelievable set of characters, I'm allowed to think this seeing as most of the historical elements are also flawed, yes, the story has to fit in with the history and vis versa, but there are some big inaccuracies here. The story feels dragged and at some points loses all interest in itself, taking away the focus from the \"main promotion\" of the film i.e. the gladiator aspect and sides more with the stale conspiracies and uninteresting characters that control them. Yes, the gladiator games are well choreographed full of action and excitement, but there is a serious lack of it in my opinion, especially for a film that is named \"Gladiator\" and features the main character who becomes a gladiator and participates in the gladiator games should have a predominate feature in the games. Obviously not in this case, this isn't criticism, I just don't understand why the political aspect has to be so major. The soundtrack to this film is one of the best scores produced by Hans Zimmer; especially towards the end. Plus the acting from Russell Crowe as Maximus is fantastic and easily brings the best role here alive with only one other actor Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus coming into the only other position of 2nd place seeing as he is really the only other developed character, not to mention that the rivalry between them is brilliantly played out even if Commodus character falls a little flat, becoming a rather alienated and brash person when it comes to decision making, but Phoenix does a great job of being paranoid. Generally all other characters seem just to fall short of this even through the script is great and well written it doesn't justify any other characters other than Maximus and Commodus, with the exception of Proximo, Lucille and Marcus but they just aren't developed enough to care but Richard Harris does deliver a fine performance. I have to say that the cinematography is amazing in this film, the CGI has stood the test of time and although some scenery and deaths look a bit...well patchy. I have to say the mise-un-scene compliments the ancient Rome style very well and even looks like it was filmed in the original robes. This film isn't a bad film at all, I found it very good, I think that Ridley Scott has made a fine film which has great acting, a decent/fairly interesting story, a well written script and perfect cinematography. But yet it does not deliver on certain aspects and jumps around to a load of characters, rather than focusing on its main ones, for a lengthy film it does drag, but this film will be a lot more

The plot of the story is one of downfall and the returning of a great hero, warrior, and man. The plot takes you to a world that is possible to imagine and is so easily and well done that you could almost believe that the movie was in fact shot in Ancient Rome. It's so expertly written that I have watched it dozens of times and still enjoy every moment of it. The story adds to the setting, character development, and overall feel of the movie. It's an amazing film as far as storytelling goes. As for the acting I can even appreciate the main villain. He comes off as a whining, simpering lunatic with quite a lot of daddy issues. Most of the time the villain is the one person I find most uninteresting, but this time I did find him interesting and due to this wanted him to die so hard. As for the main role, played by Russel Crowe, Maximus is just the guy. He's the one guy I'd want in case of zombie outbreak. Batman is well and good, but Maximus is better. Batman can abandon you and go and fight the zombies by himself and then when he returns to you he can sit there and do some detective work to try and figure out why leaving you by yourself got you killed. While Maximus will ensure the survival of you, your friends, the kid with you, the dog, the cat, and the donkey you've all got following you. In short...best cinema hero ever. A believable hero too. The settings are just amazing and really suck you into the film. Every piece, every segment looks like something you would see in Ancient Rome. From the coliseum to the streets of Rome you're made to believe that they're all in an accurately depicted ancient civilization. Not to mention the costuming also plays a big role in giving you that feel. No one is dressed out of place and the costumes due the timeline and the movie honest justice. The music is amazing, and it stands out when it needs to, and fades to the back when it needs to. They did very well on that part and unlike many movies that just like to park trumpets in your face and blow your eardrums up this one has none of that.

Great Writing!  Great Acting!  Great Directing!  Great Score!\nThis movie has it all.  I especially enjoyed the mood of the film.  Even\nthough it has a lot of action, there is a subtle elegance throughout the\npicture that gives it great style.  The movie flows effortlessly from scene\nto scene, while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and\nnail-biting excitement.The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations.  Russell Crowe\nis brilliant in his role as Maximus, the \"general who became a slave, who\nbecame a gladiator, who defied an emperor.\"  Crowe's intense style is\nperfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus.  Joaquin\nPhoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus, the corrupt emperor.\nHe plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by\nshowing certain vulnerable or fragile sides, while at the same time\ninstantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character\nshine.  It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works\nperfectly with his role.Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla.  However, perhaps the two\nfinest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans\nin supporting roles.  Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in\nwhat will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their\ncareers.  Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius, the aging Caesar who\nreflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And\nReed, especially, gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as\nProximo, the trainer for the gladiators.  The way he spoke about the life of\na gladiator, the splendor of Rome, and the \"thrill of the Coliseum\" really\nadded excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see\nmore than once to fully appreciate.  The excitement felt for me when Rome is\nfirst shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene.  But the\nwhole movie is a rush!  Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to\ncapture the different moods in the movie.  Ridley Scott sets the perfect\ntone with his artistic and creative directing.  I would recommend it to\nanyone who can stomach intensity and enjoy an epic story for the ages.

over Germania in the beginning of the movie. The dying\nemperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius, is watching this battle.The emperor's son, Commodus, then arrives with his sister Lucilla, and it is\ndiscovered that Commodus fully expects to be announced the new emperor of\nRome in a few days. Aurelius, however, has other plans--he wants to make\nMaximus emperor, and requests that of the general, who wants nothing more\nthan to go home to his family.I went into this movie having just watched Ben-Hur in my film studies class\nand having watched an episode of Xena only a couple of weeks earlier that\nfeatured the story of Marc Anthony and Cleopatra. So you could say I was in\nthe perfect mindset to watch a \"sword-and-sandal\" movie. I wasn't sure what\nto expect, having somehow avoided all the hype that accompanied this movie.\nBut I was not disappointed.Gladiator features some wonderful cinematography by John Mathieson. The\nbattle scenes are very graphic. (This movie is not for the squeamish, that's\nfor sure.) There were some scenes in particular that really struck me, such\nas when Crowe appears to be floating over the ground very fast.  The use of\ncolor and color tones added a great deal to the mood of the movie.\nExcellent.The script was being written and re-written as the filming was going on, yet\nit doesn't show that the actors had no idea how the movie was going to end\nwhen they began filming.  The acting is terrific. Russell Crowe is\nwonderfully cast as Maximus. Many reviewers agree that he is now officially\na star. Joaquin Phoenix also proves his mettle as the emotionally troubled\nCommodus, whose behavior and emotion toward his sister could give anyone the\ncreeps. Connie Nielsen makes you believe that, as Lucilla, she really is\ntorn between natural loyalty to her brother and doing what she knows is\nright. Oliver Reed, in his last performance, is memorable in his role of\nProximo, the former gladiator who is the owner of Maximus and brings him to\nRome.  In short, the actors were brilliant in their roles, not over-acting,\nbut giving subtle, strong performances.The script itself is very good.  Although some elements are a little hard to\nbelieve--the fact that no one recognizes Maximus when he's a slave?--this\nfilm calls for a willing suspension of disbelief, which one would happily\ncomply with.  (It's really no fun to nitpick such a movie.)It's true that this movie does pretty much follow the Braveheart formula.\nHowever, this movie includes some elements, such as the cinematography and\nthe incredibly graphic battle scenes (one reviewer likened it to Saving\nPrivate Ryan, \"only better\"), that are spectacular in itself.

returns with the 21st Century's answer to Cecil B\nDeMille, Ridley Scott and his dramatic tale of courage and revenge,\nGLADIATOR - \"the general who became a slave, the slave who became a\ngladiator, the gladiator who defied an emperor\".Once a great roman General, and as good as adopted son of Marcus Aurelius\nCaesar (Harris), Maximus (Crowe) is forced into exile by Commodus (Phoenix),\nheir to the throne, after the death of Marcus. Saved from death by slavers,\nhe is purchased for use as a gladiator by Proximo (Reed) and ends up in the\narena of all arena's, the Colloseum, where he proves unbeatable under his\nguise as \"The Spaniard\".And with a budget of over $100m, Scott certainly delivers the goods.\nGLADIATOR transcends the notion of 'blockbuster' that we have become\naccustomed to in the age of electronic and special effects wizardry and\ninstead offers a good old fashioned action film along the lines of Spartacus\nand and Ben Hur. Not only are we drawn into an archetypal story that\ncontains all the classic elements a filmgoer could dream of (love, loss,\ncourage, despair, good triumphing over evil etc etc) - also on offer is a\nvisual feast of cinematic painting after painting - a rich tapestry of\nimages that are breathtaking and ultimately visually satisfying. From the\nplains of Germania, to the desert stronghold of Zuchobar, and finally to\ngreat Rome herself, John Mathiesion, the cinematographer is to be commended\nhighly for his general inventiveness and ability to capture so much on film.\nThe opening  battle scene is superb as a cast of thousands erupt across the\nscreen and provide an indication that we are about to see a film that pays\nincredible attention to detail throughout its entirety. In every way, Scott\nhas created a world for us that scuttles films of similar epic undertakings\n(and budgets!) and sends them to their dooms at the bottom of the murky\ndepths of film history where they belong.The cast is generally very strong. Crowe proves himself very suitable to the\ntask with a great\nemotional range and depth of character. His accent ocassionally bugged me\n(as did the mish mash of accents on offer - but that is I guess a legacy of\n'internationally casted films'), but this aside, he was well and truly up to\nthe task. Phoenix is also excellent as the disturbed Commodus, as is Nielson\nas Lucilla, the daughter of Marcus who \"should have been a son\" and finds\nherself torn between loyalty to her brother and doing what is 'right'. The\nold guard thesps of Harris, Reed and Jacobi (Grachus) are uniformly strong\nas supporting characters, and Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) does a fine job\nas the young heir to the throne.Add to this great cast excellent editing and post production work, and an\nintricate soundscape (including a magnificent Hans Zimmer score), and you\nhave a film that, despite its length, was highly palatable and had me in\nthere from beginning to end.

Despite this, Gladiator\nis one of the most powerful and moving films I've ever seen. The plot goes\nso smooth together, as well as the acting and the terrific musical score.\nDirector Ridley Scott puts all effort into making this film an epic, and he\ndoes just that. I'd have to say that anyone who likes Ridley Scott (I sure\ndo) should see this. It is a lot like Ridley's other movies (Black Hawk Down\nwas also amazing). If you can stand a little bit--well, ok a LOT of blood\nand gore, then you should see this. Russell Crowe shows an excellent\nperformance like no other. I don't think there's one bad movie that Ridley\nScott has made or that Russell Crowe has acted in. The fact that the brutal\nbattles involving innocent slaves in this film actually happened in real\nlife centuries ago makes it even more interesting and powerful. Emperor\nCommodus is a truely evil and life-like villian who shows a lot of his wits\nin attempts to get his revenge against Maximus.Ridley Scott went to many different locations to shoot this film to make it\nreal, and he does. The film is set in Rome, and it looks just like it. You\nfeel as if you are there in the crowd, hearing them cheer and cheer to see\nthe death. To some of you, this may sound a little barbaric, and believe me\nthe film is VERY barbaric and brutual, however it teaches a very strong\nlesson of what happens when an economy turns as violent as Rome was. Ridley\nScott goes to many lengths to make this movie real, because even though the\ncharacters are fictitious, all of this really did happen. Innocent people\nhad to go through brutual fighting while thousands of people cheered for\neither their death or the enemy's death. If you were an inexperienced\nfighter, chances are you would get killed. But the strange thing is that\nRome LOVED this. People came from all over to see these fights and to see\nthe blood that was shed, that is why you can't blame the characters in this\nfilm for being so forlorn and saddened the whole time. The film itself is\nvery dark. The theme is dark and the ending is dark. From beginning to end\nthere is excessive violence (for those action movie-goers, this is a movie\nfor you). But if the violence is concerning you, don't let it. The special\neffects make the movie great, but it's the acting and storyline that make it\nspectacular.

It went on to win 5 Oscars (including Best Picture) and received a further 7 nominations. This only added to my feelings of resentment towards it.As a result, I chose to avoid seeing it again and didn't mince my words on my dislike for it. However, plenty of people - who's opinions I respect - seemed to love it. For that reason, I chose to have a reappraisal. During the days of the Roman Empire, dedicated soldier Maximus (Russell Crowe) loyally serves the emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). When the emperor is killed, Maximus refuses to transfer his loyalty to his son and new emperor, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and suffers the consequences. He is ordered to be killed but manages to escape, ending up in the hands of slave trader Proximo (Oliver Reed), who pits him into the Roman Colosseum as a gladiator. It's here that Maximus realises he can still use the arena and the crowd to his benefit and plan his revenge on Commodus. On only my second viewing of this film, my opinion has changed and changed for the better. I still have issues with it but it's granduer is undeniably impressive and as a slice of entertainment it can't be faulted. I can honestly admit now, that my scornful opinion of this film was slightly unjust. It was much better than I remember but still not the classic it's proclaimed to be. For a start, it has a high tendency for melodrama. This is acceptable in some cases but with the acclimations that Gladiator has recieved over the years, I find it needs to be scrutinised a little further. One of the main causes for it's melodramatic approach is some ridiculous dialogue. Reportedly, during production Russell Crowe himself had complaints with screenwriter William Nicholson's dialogue, apparently telling him it was \"garbage\". I found that to be the case in several scenes and when delivering it, the uncomfortableness in the actors looked apparent. However, they manage to carry it well enough; Crowe is a commanding presence in his Oscar winning role but it's by no means his best performance. I think his abilities were better tested the year before in \"The Insider\", where he was absolutely superb and deserved the Oscar then. Phoenix is another actor I admire and he also delivers a good performance but unfortunately suffers with a poorly written and stereotypical character. He's no more than a cartoon villain - complete with dark eye shadow - and he couldn't really get any more nasty. Old hands, Harris and Reed phone their performances in and it looks as if Reed is just there for the beer tokens. Jacobi, however brief, shows his thespian abilities and the always excellent Djimon Hounsou is wasted in another poorly written role. There's not a lot going on for the character's as ultimately, this is all about the spectacle. And a fine, grandiose one it is. With \"Blade Runner\" and most recently \"Prometheus\", Scott has never been known to scrimp on the visual front and this is no different. It is exquisitely detailed (kudos to cinematographer John Mathieson) and filmed in the grandest of scales. The director can't be faulted in his ability to capture the hearts and minds of an audience and this is no more apparent than the impressively choreographed battle scenes and wonderfully ethereal afterlife sequences - shot with a highly artistic eye. Such scenes are afforded a greater power by a superb score from Hans Zimmer and the amazing vocal talents of Lisa Gerrard (for those unaware, check out her beautiful work with Australian outfit \"Dead Can Dance\"). On a visual and audio front, this film can't be reckoned with but unfortunately, I found it to succumb to formula. Despite the fact that the real life Commodus did actually fight in the the gladiatorial arena, the ending stretched credulity for me but I suppose dramatic license is commonplace in film's of this type. I enjoyed this a far-sight more than I used to, as it's undeniably epic and visually arresting. Essentially though, this is an action movie. A good one but not much more than an action movie dressed in the Emperor's clothes.", :title=>nil, :location=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"rotten_tomatoes",
