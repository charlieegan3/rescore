There are plenty of anti-heroes in good films, like \"Leon\" for example. Or, The Professional if you will. The film was originally titled Leon in France but then changed to The Professional when it came over to America. I guess because they figured that American audiences wouldn't be interested in seeing a movie titled Leon, they'd just miss out on what the film was really about.I think the difference in something like \"Leon\" is that while he's an assassin for hire, he's only going out and killing other drug dealers and corrupt cops and people who are as vile or worse. There's a code he follows. So it's like the lesser of two evils, you can relate with him because he's better then the people he combats. Same with Batman, he's a vigilante and thus a criminal, but he follows a code and commits violence against those even worse then he is. While in Shawshank... the convicts are imprisoned for committing crimes against innocent people, we assume. We don't really find out the specific circumstances, but it's generally understood that these people were not committing crimes against even worse human beings.So this aura of reverence and love for the film has always mystified me. I'm not going to say it's a bad film. The cinematography and acting all seem fairly competent. But it just didn't do anything for me. I felt bored by it. And ya know, listening to people hyping it up to be one of the greatest films ever made didn't help either. It's number one on IMDB's top 250 greatest, for God's sake. And there're plenty of people out there who'll tell you it should've won Best Picture over Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump. Me, I'm of the opinion Forrest Gump rightfully deserved the award.

AndyPerhaps it can be frowned upon to view a prison drama in such high regard, it may indeed paint a false picture of real life situations, but at the end of the day, the entertainment value and lasting effect of The Shawshank Redemption, a truly emotional discovery and, well, redemption. Everything aside, the film is simply about a friendship under the most unorthodox of circumstances. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is locked up in Shawshank prison in 1947, being convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is initially given a hard time as being the new guy, but his generally laid back attitude catch the attention of Red (Morgan Freeman). As Andy and Red get to know each other, Red soon realises that perhaps there is more than meets the eye with his new acquaintance, as Andy slowly begins to change the lives of the people closest to him. Unfortunately as time goes on, Andy's impatience starts with his life inside starts to show, he seems more reckless and outspoken, regardless of how he has made small but significant changes to the prison itself and of course its inmates. We are left to watch Andy's journey through the wonderful narration of Morgan Freeman's Red, who is constantly but pleasantly surprised at Andy's personality and reactions to his surroundings. The true friendship lies where these two are completely different, Red has made peace with his situation, accepting his fate and serving life, but Andy is determined to \"Get busy living\". Tim Robbins perfectly portrays a character who is purposely isolated from everyone, he can very much take care of himself and show is intelligence and cunning nature at many shining moments in this remarkable film. Morgan Freeman is very much the good guy who followed the wrong path, he gets on with almost everyone who is worth getting on with and doesn't cause trouble, apart from being the \"go to' guy in the prison. The word perfect could indeed give the justice this movie deserves. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is powerful and absorbing, he is always trying to make you become part of the walls that these prisoners call home, his various shots including a few prisoners sitting on top of the roof in the early morning drinking beer and another when Andy manages to play Mozart through the tannoy system speaks waves to the capabilities not necessarily by the actors, but to the scenery that they are surrounded by, and it is truly breathtaking. It's just a show that is too good to miss, it emerged out of nowhere and really hit home on an emotional level, there is no action in it, simply life lessons that need to be heard, each character has a vibrant role to play that will make us concerning of their situations, and Frank Darabont has created a perfectly diverse cast to blend in with this masterful and commanding film.", :useful=>[0.0, 0], :username=>"StevenF", :date=>"Apr 13, 2013", :location=>nil, :title=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"metacritic", :url=>"http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-shawshank-redemption"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"Perhaps it can be frowned upon to view a prison drama in such high regard, it may indeed paint a false picture of real life situations, but at the end of the day, the entertainment value and lasting effect of The Shawshank Redemption, a truly emotional discovery and, well, redemption.

It's too slow. The Shawshank Redemption may be a tad slow, but it is justified. I believe director Frank Darabont wanted to show Andy's time at Shawshank by showing how slow prison time really is. Some movies are just slow; this movie does it for a deeper reason, adding to Shawshank's genius. 2. Andy Dufresne barely shows emotion. Those people obviously didn't get what kind of character Andy was. Tim Robbins did this on purpose. Andy was quiet, mellow, and was obviously quite shocked and angry he was going to prison for a crime he didn't do. Did you really expect the man to jump up and start singing \"Kumbaya\"? No! So I don't get what the problem is. The fact that he acted like this just added to the realistic atmosphere of the movie. 3. This is not realistic. Oh yes your right, since these men in prison smoked, cursed, drank, and kept their eyes peeled in the shower room for potential rapists. That is not realistic at all. (sarcastic) Overall, I think some of the hate on Shawshank is solely because it is the highest rated movie on IMDb, for a fact. (User rating is 9.3 to this date). I think some people hate this movie because everyone else loves it, and that is a bad way to think about anything, not just movies.

moves anyone who watches it. This movie is grand in scope and scale, its character portrayals so moving and so real, that you cannot help becoming completely engrossed by it. I believe that the Shawshank Redemption is one of these movies. Often times, movies based on books are sub par, with the common complaint being, \"The book is better.\" Well I, for one, have read the book and watched the movie, and I assure you that the movie is not a let down at all, but rather a triumph of modern cinema. The DVD disc itself is a little thin on features, but at an average price of about $15, anyone with a DVD player and a taste for Drama(or anyone who simply likes excellent movies) should own this movie on DVD.  Now, on to the movie itself. The Shawshank Redemption saw career-defining performances from many of its cast members,including Tim Robbins, who became a top star after his incredible performance, and Morgan Freeman, who added to his already impressive list of accolades with his perfect supporting role. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a Maine banker who is unjustly convicted of killing his wife and her lover after he discovers that she is having an affair. Andy is a true outsider in the bleak world of Shawshank prison, an educated man not used to violence and despair that are an everyday part of prison life. Robbins plays this part to perfection, showing emotional vulnerability, as well as the stregnth to overcome the greatest adversity. Freeman plays Red, \"The man who can get it all,\" a prisoner serving a life sentence for murder, who befriends Andy. Red adapts to his life in prison by becoming a source for bringing outside goods to prisoners.  The interplay between Robbins and Freeman is one of the highlights of the movie, as these two wonderful actors test each other's limits. James Whitmore plays Brooks Hatlin, a man who spends his entire life in Shawshank as a librarian. Once released,as an old man, Brooks finds that he would rather die that live another day in a unfamiliar world. His character is a tragic example of how the human mind can become so attached to its circumstances(even the blak setting of a prison) that it simply cannot let go of them. Bob Gunton takes a memorable turn as Bible-quoting Warden Samuel Norton, whose facade of morality is merely a mask for his depraved behavior and illegal activites.  Frank Darabont, who wrote the screenplay and directed this movie,is a master of skilfully portraying human emotions. He deserves all the credit he gets for helping to shape this memorable movie experience. Stepen King's brilliance shines through, as his ability to create complex and memorable characters is evident in this movie.  The bottom line is this: The Shawshank Redemption is a monumental achievement in motion picture history. It is defined by a memorable story, engrossing character performances, and one of the most truly gratifying endings I have ever seen in a movie. This is truly one of the greatest movies ever made.", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[121, 129], :date=>" 2000 October 26", :title=>"A Triumph", :location=>"(Nashville, TN United States)",

A movie where you don't sit through it and think to yourself how you might have done it all differently had you been  the director. I have a couple of movies like that, and \"The Shawshank  Redemption\" is one of them. I still remember clearly walking out of  the theater in 1994 and thinking that I've just seen one of the best movies  that I'll ever have the pleasure of sitting through. A movie so elegant and  emotional that is perfect in its way of storytelling. A movie that is about  how hope can never die. The movie earned several Academy Award nominations  that were certainly well-deserved, but it left theaters all too quickly.  Over the years though, it has gained a strong cult following.The movie  stars Tim Robbins in one of his very best performances as Andrew Dufresne,  a quiet man who is convicted of the murder of his wife and is sent to  Shawshank prison. It's there he meets \"Red\", a convict played by  Morgan Freeman who gets things from the outside for a price. He first sees  Andy as he's lead into the prison and predicts that he won't last long  inside the prison walls. Over time though, he's suprised that the young man  is able to survive and soon, the two become friends with respect for each  other. Andy is not a man who \"fights the system\". He spends his  days in his own quiet world, a courage that the other prisoners don't quite  understand at first. Robbins has built this character in a way that we  the performance is not showy, but subtle. The result is that we want to  know more and when we do begin to understand his ways, that only makes us  want him to succeed that much more. I won't go into much more in the way of  detail about the movie; if you haven't seen it, I don't want to ruin any of  the enjoyment of the movie; if you have, I'm sure you already have your  feelings about the movie. This is a movie that's not depressing; it has a  lot of life to it and I think that when they look back at the 90's, they  will see that this is one of the best pictures that was released during  this time.Yes, Warner Brothers has proven to made an error in judgement  about their way of going about putting this DVD out. There was an  announcement over a year ago, I believe; then previous announcements came  later after the first delay promising a director's commentary, then a  Morgan Freeman commentary, then, in the final moments before the DVD is  released this week...nothing. It's a shame, as \"Shawshank\" is a  film deserving of much more. I suppose part of me is happy with the fact  that this film is finally on DVD, although if this is the final product,  there is no reason in my mind that this couldn't have been released a long,  is an excellent looking image. One of the best cinematographers in the  business (Roger Deakins- \"Fargo\") did the filming on this picture  and the pale colors are represented well throughout the picture, mainly  browns and greys. Like the movie, there is an elegance to the visual style  on this picture that is apparent in every movie that Deakins has worked on.  Images are clear and crisp throughout; sharp, but not overly sharp for a  \"smooth\" feeling that looks very film-like.There are few  problems, and none of them are terribly distracting at all. There is a  slight shimmering in a scene or two and some very small instances of grain.  Other than that, this is an excellent looking image that will certainly  beautiful sound mix. It's also a newly remastered 5.1 mix. It's not flashy  or showy, nor does it need to be. It does however, do what it needs to do  best very well. The score by Thomas Newman is absolutely wonderful and it  sounds clear and crisp throughout the picture. Surrounds are put into use  occasionally, but always in a subtle way that is right for the picture.  What I was pleased about most though, was how rich and clean the score  sounded on this DVD. Dialogue is clear and without problems as well.

Why only four stars then? Because we are asked to rate the DVD, not the movie, and the criminal lack of DVD extras for one of the best films ever made is shameful. So, film five stars, DVD three - averaging out at 4. Maths lesson over, on with the review.  Based on the Stephen King novella ' Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption ' this really has become a modern day classic. Other films have grossed more, and may have a more immediate following, but Shawshank will endure for years, and become another 'Casablanca ' loved by generations to come.  The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, sent to the maximum security prison of Shawshank for the murder of his wife and her lover. Played with an under-stated intelligence by Tim Robbins in a career defining turn, and supported by sterling performances from Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, and veteran James Whitmore. Morgan Freeman's work is particularly notable, not just for his performance ( let's face it, the man doesn't know how to give a bad one! ) but also for the fact that his is the voice of the film. His chocolate-rich tones were director Frank Darabont's choice for the voice-over of the film, as if his character Red is talking to us, and explaining the sub-text of the film. Voice overs often dont work ( Blade Runner being a prime example ) but this one does, perfectly.  Beginning at a slow pace, the film begins with the brutal de-humanising regime meted out to the 'Fresh Fish' as they begin their incarcaration in Shawshank. I remember suggesting my wife watch the film after I'd seen it, and she, being of a considerably more sensitive nature than me, found the early scenes difficult. If you too find the opening 45 minutes a tad heavy going, stick with it - the reward is worth it.  Eventually as we progress through the film, we see how Red's initial suspicion of Andy becomes a deep respect, and eventually a deep friendship, indeed it would be true to say that these two men love each other like brothers by the end. There are a few key scenes that really stick in the memory - the rooftop scene, the opera aria scene, the exam result scene - all of which enable us to begin to like these men, men we probably wouldn't have wanted in our homes before the film, but who we'd happily sit down to dinner with after.  The film's true emotional impact of course comes in the final third as we learn the truth about Andy's guilt or otherwise. True to many of King's works, there is a twist in the end which leaves us all stunned, and with a big stupid grin on our faces. The total and utter defeat of the dark forces in the film is accomplished with such applomb that you find yourself rooting for the bad guys  - the prisoners, a bunch of murderers and misfits that two hours earlier you were deeply suspicious of. Indeed the last section of the film plays almost totally without our hero, and remains almost my favourite portion of it. By this time we are crying out for the final fulfilment of our hopes for the characters. It is to Frank Darabont's eternal credit that he accomplishes this in a scene without dialogue, and a sweeping panoramic withdrawl from the characters, leaving us with not a dry eye in the house, and a feel-good glow that lasts for days. ... while in [a local store] I noticed this man and wife trying to decide which DVD they would buy to view that evening. I pointed to Shawshank. \"Ever seen this one?\"\"No\"\"Trust me\" I said, \"It's the best movie you've never seen.\" He bought it, and I like to think I made that man and wife cry, laugh and smile that evening.  To conclude, Warner Bros and Castle Rock - SHAME ON YOU! This movie deserves better. The Region 2 version rocks, so get busy, re-package, and give us fans the extras this classic deserves!P.S. The ten-year anniversary edition has righted many wrongs. The film has finally been done justice. I watched it again the other night, and again my eyes welled up at the end.

Whether it was the lack of a catchy title, or the rather bland movie poster showing Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the true spirit of this film never got the attention it deserved at it's big-screen opening.  For this, I'm guilty, too.  I showed no interest in it when it opened.  Never have I been so wrong in judging a movie.  The motion picture awards institutions were wrong in not properly recognizing this film as possibly the greatest of all time.  I never expected a prison film to be my all-time favorite.It was two precious years before my brother convinced me to see it.  I must say, no film has ever driven me to tears like this one did.  It is a compelling story of the strength of human character, emerging from the most hopeless of situations.  As it turns out, hope is exactly what empowers the prisoners of Shawshank.(Spoiler ahead!) The cinematography and musical score are magical, especially in the scene where Red is dropped off in Buxton to search the fields for Andy's stash, and where he finally reunites with Andy in Mexico.  It just streams with emotion.  The script: superbly written.  All this was put together by a talented director who can go to his grave knowing he orchestrated one of the finest films in history.

Walker", :location=>"from Paducah, KY", :date=>"27 August 2002", :content=>"\n\nCan Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only,\ncreate art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach\nit\nin a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a\ndaunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable\nmanagerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of\nart in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting.\nThese elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet\nstill form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of\nthe artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for\nhis\nnotable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his\nfeature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself\nalready a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most\nrecognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The\nShawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the\nemotions,\nand brings an era of artistically influential films back to\nHollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense,\nvictimized\nby circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his\nwife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a\nlife sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in\nthis prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls\naround him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from\nhis fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly\nreferred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within\nthe drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare\nto\nthe confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope\ncauses\nRed to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy\nproves\nto Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank\nprison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled\nscreenplay\npaved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with\nthe phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella,\nRita\nHayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that\nhe can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous\npiece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many\nways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas\nwhere the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film\ntransitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella,\nDarabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of\nemotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the\ncunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred\nNewman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing\nNewman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as\nif a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism\nand tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score\ncomposition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score\nreceived an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent,\nNewman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from\nthe film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers,\ncomposers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast\nof The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The\nmarvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most\nconvincing\nperformances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan\nFreeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting\nlies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear\ninto their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James\nWhitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man\nincarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself\nattached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these\nactors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their\nmotivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to\nanything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the\nmost beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as\nits focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope\nand\nfreedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly\nyearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws\nits\naudience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart\nwill go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions,\nand deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a\ngreat\nnovel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply\nentertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully,\nillustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us\na\npoignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we\nall seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it\nlong lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability.

Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and\nPulp Fiction were \"just happy to be nominated.\" Of course hindsight is\n20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and\nRedemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however,\nwas a success from the word \"go,\" making a huge splash at Cannes and\nmaking its writer-director an American master after only two films. For\nAndy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure\nwasn't a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell\nfast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for\nfailure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans\ntoday, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was.\nOn the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on\n\"that 'Rickshaw' movie.\" Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as\n'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between\ntwo best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie\nis slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post,\n\"it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance\nof narrative exit points before settling on its finale.\" But it is\nthese same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a\ntotal eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and\nGothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts\nits shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above\nevery shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all\nmemories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope.\nIt's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; \"In here's\nwhere you need it most,\" he says. \"You need it so you don't forget.\nForget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of\nstone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's\nyours, that they can't touch.\" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much\nof Andy at first, picking \"that tall glass o' milk with the silver\nspoon up his ass\" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word,\nand losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two\nget to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This\nagain, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about\nlove, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the\nonly one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two\nbest friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship\ntime and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's\nday to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional,\nbut Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film\nis much better for it.It's pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the\nsame actors, it is easy to forget that the movie's timeline spans well\nover 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in\nreality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it's not as if the\nfilm lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it's going,\nit merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off\nas well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more\nexhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be\nforgotten.With themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to\nbe found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ\nfigure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard\nNixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they\ncome. But if you aren't looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to\nanyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving\nfilm, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don't come much\nbetter than this.OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message\nof hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved\nthere is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran\nsolely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of\n1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally\nswapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time --\nredemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you\nwaiting for? As Andy says, \"It comes down a simple choice, really.\nEither get busy living, or get busy dying.\"\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161"},

In addition to its Oscar nominations and huge critical acclaim, the film has topped the IMDb Top 250 for years and shows no signs of dropping off any time soon. Any attempt to criticise it could come across as churlish or contrarian, the work of someone attempting to be above what is popular for their own self-righteous sake. Fortunately, there is little need to criticise - for Shawshank really is as great as people make it out to be.It's easy to forget how much of a slow-burning success Shawshank was. Despite favourable reviews and its many nominations, the film barely broke even on first release. It was only with the VHS release that word began to spread like wildfire, so that by the turn of the century it had garnered a reputation as a modern American great. In an age where films are dead in the water if they don't perform on opening weekend, it is hard to imagine a situation in which another Shawshank could emerge (although Slumdog Millionaire is a reasonable candidate).It's equally easy to forget how brutal the film is, particularly in its first 20 minutes. Shawshank's reputation as a popular favourite might lead the uninitiated to thinking that it's an uplifting, feel-good film - and it is true that these later moments are the ones which have most entered into popular consciousness. But any film about hope needs a source of despair to provide conflict, and Shawshank has more than enough violence and emotional trauma to justify its 15 certificate. As Mark Kermode famously remarked, there's a whole lot of Shawshank before the Redemption.Even without its reputation, Shawshank is one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work. Indeed, among King's dramatic stories, it is outshone only by its successor The Green Mile. Frank Darabont has a greater understanding of King than almost any other filmmaker: he gets the tone spot on and recreates the period setting brilliantly with the help of Roger Deakins' cinematography. Despite the much-parodied narration that punctuates the film, the drama unfolds naturally and believably throughout, with the characters always being at the forefront and naked exposition being kept to a bare minimum.Shawshank is a good example of how adaptation works - or more specifically, how changes made to the original story in translation often benefit the finished product. The best example of this is the character of Red, who in the original novel is a red-headed Irishman. This is referred to jokingly by Morgan Freeman in one of his first conversations with Tim Robbins; when Andy asks why people call him Red, Red responds: \"Maybe it's because I'm Irish.\".On top of Freeman's obvious ability, the casting decision makes sense because it adds an extra layer of meaning to the character. Red is one of the few black characters we come across; while he applies himself in different ways, he is as much of an outsider as Andy DuFresne. This is borne out by his remarks about institutionalisation, which are laughed off by his fellow inmates. Red may be well-connected when it comes to smuggling things in, but otherwise he is just as lonely as Andy.Shawshank approaches the theme of institutionalisation with great grace and dexterity. Because the story takes place over three decades, the temptation would be to canter through the plot points and cut straight to Andy's escape - you could even stage the entire story in flashback. Instead, Darabont allows the film to unfold at a gentle, gradual pace, reflecting the mind-set of the characters. They don't realise how trapped they are until it's too late, just as we don't realise that two-and-a-half hours has passed until the credits have begun to roll.The characters reflect the different extents and effects of institutionalisation. Brooks has built his entire identity around his books and role in the prison; he is so afraid of this being taken away that he attempts to kill William Sadler's character so he can stay inside. Red is aware of how trapped he is, and shares Brooks' fears, being unsure that he could get things for Andy on the outside. But at the same time, he refuses to let himself be vulnerable, trying to play the system and constantly getting turned down for parole. Andy allows himself to be vulnerable and endures all the pain that it brings him, sustained by the knowledge of his innocence and the hope that he will escape.Shawshank is perhaps the most powerful depiction of hope in all of cinema. The original short story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, was subtitled 'Hope Springs Eternal'. The film returns to hope and the celebration of the human spirit like a leitmotif, and succeeds because it retains Andy's humanity in all its many shades. While he is very different to the other prisoners, he is never presented as a saint or goody-goody, smiling gormlessly in the face of maddening torment. This makes his endurance all the more powerful: we recognise our faults in his moments of weakness, and aspire to his inner moral strength.The film has attracted many Christian interpretations - in fact, in my review of John Carpenter's The Thing, I called it \"a poster child for Christianity\". It's not hard to see why, considering its celebration of inner strength and devotion, and its overall arc of good triumph over evil against the greatest odds. While Andy has been called a Christ figure, he's just as close to the character of Daniel in the Old Testament: he finds himself in a strange land against his will, and in order to survive he applies his natural talents to the service of his temporal masters. Through his labours the people around him benefit and the system is eventually changed for the better - albeit through pain, suffering and several deaths.An equally intriguing interpretation comes from Mark Kermode, who authored a BFI Modern Classic on the film in 2003. In a video discussing cinematic depictions of Richard Nixon, Kermode made the argument that Warden Norton (played brilliantly by Bob Gunton) is an allegory for Nixon, with Andy's prison term matching Nixon's political career. Norton begins reaching out for friendship (Nixon seeking to be elected), then becomes the corrupt leader (beginning in the year that Kennedy was shot), and finally descends into paranoia and disgrace, culminating in a more literal suicide than Nixon offered us.Whether you believe these interpretations or not, Shawshank is a terrific piece of dramatic film-making which soars on the strengths of its main performers. Tim Robbins perfectly captures Andy's distant, ethereal quality while retaining his wry and infectious sense of humour. Morgan Freeman's performance may well be responsible for his subsequent type-casting, but he matches Robbins beat for beat, offsetting hope with world-weariness and guilt. There's also great support from two actors who would subsequently work with Darabont again - William Sadler (who appears in The Green Mile) and James Whitmore (The Majestic).The only fly in the ointment with Shawshank is its ending. The film is about hope as a value in and of itself, emphasising the importance of having it even if it is not rewarded. Red's transition to embracing hope is far more important than his reunion with Andy, and this reunion shifts the film's message from celebrating hope to justifying the characters' pain on the basis of a happy ending. It's also clear that this ending was put together at the last minute, with subtle shifts in the cinematography and a far more rushed pacing to it.The Shawshank Redemption may not be entirely worthy of its number one ranking on IMDb, but it remains a really terrific piece of drama let down only by its final scene. In every other aspect it's a masterpiece, as a character piece, a treatise on hope and a beautifully paced and mounted Stephen King adaptation. It remains a must-see for all film fans of penchant or persuasion, earning its status as a modern classic and securing a warm place in our hearts.", :title=>nil, :location=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"rotten_tomatoes", :url=>"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shawshank_redemption"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"Before we can critically assess The Shawshank Redemption, we first have to deal with The Shawshank Reputation.", :clean_text=>"before we can critically assess the shawshank redemption we first have to deal with the shawshank reputation.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"In addition to its Oscar nominations and huge critical acclaim, the film has topped the IMDb Top 250 for years and shows no signs of dropping off any time soon.", :clean_text=>"in addition to its oscar nominations and huge critical acclaim the film has topped the imdb top 250 for years and shows no signs of dropping off any time soon.", :sentiment=>1, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>2, :text=>"Any attempt to criticise it could come across as churlish or contrarian, the work of someone attempting to be above what is popular for their own self-righteous sake.", :clean_text=>"any attempt to criticise it could come across as churlish or contrarian the work of someone attempting to be above what is popular for their own self-righteous sake.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>3, :text=>"Fortunately, there is little need to criticise -

At best, it is a searing depiction of the corruption that sometimes goes on at the highest rankings (a disturbing turn from Bob Gunton as Warden Norton), as well as the ugliness that engulfs prison life. This is not a perfect movie, notably because it contains a useless section involving Robbins educating a troubled inmate, for the sole sake of showing just how corrupt the Warden is (but we already know he is, the story does not need to hammer it down anymore).

The best thing about this movie, for me, was the flashback sequences to Vito's early years, how he ended up living in America, how he got started in the mafia, how he made his first (I presume it was his first) kill, how he set up his most important element: Family. The absence of Marlon Brando is evident here, but its made up for as we have Robert De Niro playing the young Don Corleone. There is a vast difference between Michael and his deceased father, Vito. Vito immensly loved his family and it was evident that family was the most important thing to him. To Michael, that is not true. Note how he smacks Kay across the face, how he refuses to let her see his children, how he orders the execution of his brother Fredo. The final scene, where we got a flashback to the family at the table for Vitos surprise party, is quite a well executed scene, and it was interesting to see the familys reaction to Michael joining the Marines and that it was Sonny who introduced the despicable wife beater Carlo to Connie.

If one looks back at that wonderful decade of cinema, he or she would see 'Colossal' films like Taxi Driver, Apocalypse Now, Annie Hall, Means Streets, Jaws, Chinatown, The Godfather (Its Predecessor) and many more. But, I think, the film which captures 6 Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Art-Direction and Best Actor in a Supporting Role) surpasses them all, and that film is The Godfather Part II. To begin with it's acting would be a pleasure to me. \"Sun rising to shine the world\" That would be the expression to depict it's masterful acting. Well supported by it's supporting players and that include Robert Duvall (extremely impressive), John Cazale, Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo. Al Pacino plays the cold Michael Corleone, who's delivery entertained me with some kind of realism. Just rightfully perfect, I could conclude that he's transformed or easily put, Al gives a perfect performance which deserved an Oscar for best performance of the year. Just somewhere in that corner of brilliance, one could see a composed acting of Robert Deniro as young Vito Corleone. It is like pure cloud gathering all around him, truly an unforgettable contribution. In summary, it could be commented that this piece is a well acted motion picture. The element which grasped my attention is Coppola's method of slow or methodical filmmaking which captures the beauty of this cinema. Beautifully shot from start to finish, it is a breathtaking sight of grandeur. This film is a cleverly written piece too. Completed with inspiring dialogue, attractive epic storytelling and it could be easily 'snatched'that it is masterful. Many would disagree with me because I'm going to, or will always name this picture as 'The Greatest Film Ever Made'. The Godfather is an offer you can't refuse but The Godfather Part II is an offer you MUST NOT refuse.

The film focuses on the twin stories of Michael Corleone's attempt to consolidate his power as Godfather of the Corleone family by, as he puts it, killing all his enemies.  The latter primarily include a Jewish gangster who was a former associate of his father as a young man, a former associate who turns government witness, and his brother Fredo, who betrays Michael because he felt passed over and because in betraying Michael there would be \"something in it for me.\"  The other story told is that of the youth and young manhood of Vito Corleone, magnificently portrayed by Robert De Niro in one of his greatest performances, performing his role in Italian and doing a masterful job of mimicking Marlon Brando's intonations from the previous film.  The story takes him from his earlier childhood, with the death of all the members of his family in Sicily, to his immigration to the United States, and eventual involvement in a life of organized crime.Much of the power of the second film comes from the contrast between the two stories.  As Vito Corleone grows in power, he also grows as a family man, in both the sense of a father with children and a wife and in the extended sense in his role as Godfather.  He becomes the center of a community, drawing others around him.  But the other story, of the decay of all that Vito had built up through the leadership of Michael, betrays all the realities undergirding the delusions riddling Vito Corleone's Family.  The rot and decay that characterizes Michael's reign are shown as the natural and inescapable result of the greed that drove the lives of those in the crime organization.  Nonetheless, the contrast between Vito, surrounded by friends and family and associates, and Michael, killing friends and associates and even family members, alienating even his most loyal friends, sitting inside his armed compound alone couldn't be starker.  There is a reverse symmetry between the two stories:  Vito starts off alone and ends surrounded by family and friends, while Michael starts off surrounded with family and friends, and ends up alone.  This is symbolized perfectly in the final scene in the film, in a flashback to December 7, 1941, when Michael reveals to his brothers that he has enlisted in the Army.  They hear their father arrive elsewhere in the house and rush off to meet him, only Michael sitting at the table alone as the film ends.As with the first film, the acting is beyond reproach.  As great as Al Pacino has been in his career, Michael Corleone has been his greatest achievement.  He and Robert De Niro excel in the two key roles in the film.  Lee Strasberg came out of retirement to play Hyman Roth, and he was extraordinarily effective in the role.  The late, great John Cazale was marvelously timid as the dim, confused, and indecisive Fredo, who both adored and resented his brother Michael.  Michael Gazzo is unforgettable as Frank Pentangeli, who thinks he has been betrayed by Michael and turns government witness, and received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for his performance (he was beaten out by Robert De Niro), as was Lee Strasberg.  Robert Duvall returns as Tom Hagen, who is more loyal to Michael than anyone else but who Michael distrusts nonetheless.  Bizarrely, Al Pacino lost out to Art Carney, who was excellent in the rather minor film HARRY AND TONTO.  It is hard today to understand how Pacino failed to win.", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[75, 83], :date=>" 2003 June 3", :title=>"An extraordinary sequel to a great American classic

the Will to Power in 1974's THE GODFATHER, PART II. Universally considered one of the greatest films ever crafted along with its twin, the original THE GODFATHER (1972), THE GODFATHER, PART II continues the tragic tale of kingship and kinship begun in the earlier film.Coppola creates a fascinating film study of Father and Son, as he compares and contrasts the middle-aged Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) and the young Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro) as the former falls from authority into corruption and decline and the latter rises from obscurity to strength and power.In two brilliantly crafted parallel period tales spanning the twentieth century, we watch the Father create a self-contained universe centered around Family, while the Son slowly destroys what his Father hath wrought.DeNiro's Vito Corleone begins life as a frightened immigrant child fleeing a vendetta in Sicily; at his apotheosis, in an act of filial piety he kills Don Ciccio, the man responsible for his own father's, mother's and brother's deaths. Pacino's Michael Corleone begins the film at the height of his powers, then falls deeper and deeper into his own internal darkness. At his nadir, in an act of complete abnegation, he kills his own misguided brother, Fredo (John Cazale).The difference between them is manifest in that while Don Vito kills only two men (the aforementioned Don Ciccio, and Don Fanucci, a neighborhood predator who takes away Vito's job as a grocery clerk, leaving him unable to feed his Family and driving him into a life of crime), Don Michael is drenched in the blood of other men. Where Don Vito uses his own inherent self-respect and the finespun fear others' feel to serve the essentially unselfish ends of protecting the defenseless in his world, Michael uses the brute force of his personality and unrestrained violence to maintain his own personal wealth and power, ultimately squandering both, and in the end, sacrificing both respect and Family.The organized crime elements of this film are a dramatic backdrop to the biographical elements. They propel the story but are not the core of it.Robert DeNiro's Oscar-winning performance as Don Vito Corleone marked the only time that two actors won Academy Awards for the same role (along with Marlon Brando as Don Vito in THE GODFATHER). Pacino's parallel performance as Don Michael is a bleak study in genius, well-deserving its own Oscar.A gifted film, THE GODFATHER, PART II remains one of the few sequels to match or outmatch it's

history that are as revered as \"The Godfather\".  There are so many memorable performances and so many memorable scenes that there's no dispute over it sitting in the #1 All-Time position on the Internet Movie Database's (IMDB) Top 250 list.  Normally, trying to follow up such a cinematic masterpiece with a sequel is a foolhardy endeavor.  The performances and brilliant storytelling tend to falter in the next movie.  Seldom does a drama produce a worthy sequel.  In the case of \"The Godfather\", it easily produced the 'sequel that is equal' with \"...Part II\".  Listed in the #3 slot in the IMDB Top 250 All-Time, \"The Godfather, Part II\" is an even more ambitious film than the original.  So ambitious, in fact, that many fans of the \"Godfather\" films feel it may actually be superior to the original.  I do not share that opinion.  At best, I feel it is just as good as the original.  At worst, it is just a tiny bit less of a film than \"...Part I\".  I feel that, while \"...Part II\" is more ambitious, it lacks the grand scale of the original, especially in the scenes involving Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) control of the family 'business' in the late 1950's.  This is hardly a criticism, though.  In fact, the lack of grand scale of this 'family' is symbolic of how Michael's chilling rule has wrecked was the family once was, instead of being indicative of lackluster filmmaking.  Director Francis Ford Coppola took a risky, but ultimately reward, approach to the story of \"The Godfather, Part II\".  He wanted to tell the story of a young Vito Corleone's (played by Robert DeNiro here) rise to power simultaneously with his son Michael's fall from grace some 40 years apart.  The two parallel stories have a marvelous interplay with one another.  At no point, when film shifts from one time period to the other, does it feel forced or jarring.  There is always some sort of connection, however subtle, between the end of a scene in one time period and the beginning of one in the other.  The story of the young Vito Corleone begins in 1901 in Sicily at the funeral for his father who murdered for an insult to local Mafia chieftain.  His mother, who lost her other son when he was killed trying to avenge his father, visits the chieftain, Don Ciccio, in an attempt to spare the life of her youngest, 'dumb-witted' son, Vito.  When Ciccio refuses, she attempts to murder him and winds up being killed herself.  Vito runs away and, with the help of friends of the family, avoids capture by Ciccio's men and is placed on a ship to America.  A leap forward to 1958 shows Vito's grandson, Anthony receiving his first Communion and the subsequent reception afterwards at Michael Corleone's Lake Tahoe compound, where Michael receives visitors and requests for favors much the same way Vito did on his daughter's wedding at the beginning of the original \"Godfather\".  Each story, on it's own, is quite fascinating.  Weaved together, they are magnificent.  The tale of Vito Corleone shows his rise from being just another Italian immigrant to becoming one of the most powerful underworld figures in New York and the strengthening of the Corleone family.  In contrast, the tale of Michael Corleone shows the disintegration of his family and his 'family' as a result of his cold, iron-fisted leadership and paranoia over any betrayals, either real or perceived.  The very end of Michael Corleone story shows the depressingly haunting image of Michael sitting amongst the fallen leaves of fall with only the 'button' men around him in the compound, as he has pushed away every single person who was close to him.  It's a tragic ending of Shakespearean proportions in direct contrast to the seemingly boundless future that seems to await the Corleone's at the end of the Vito Corleone story.  As with the original \"Godfather\", the performances in \"...Part II\" are nothing short of spectacular.  Pacino chillingly portrays Michael Corleone's continued decent into evil.  The progression of his character from the war hero who wanted nothing to do with the family business (in \"...Part I\") to the most ruthless of mafia leaders (in \"...Part II\") is truly disturbing.  Pacino makes Michael the embodiment of pure evil.  Not even his wife or his children (or even his brother) are safe from his wrath.  The fact that he didn't win a Best Actor Oscar for this performance is almost as criminal as the Corleone family business.  Robert DeNiro gives an equally accomplished performance as a young Vito Corleone (who was played by Marlon Brando in the original movie).  The mannerisms and demeanor that DeNiro brings to his portrayal of a young Vito leave the audience completely convinced that this is how Vito looked and acted at this age.  Unlike Pacino, though, DeNiro was not overlooked for his performance and won an Oscar for Best Support Actor.  There are other remarkable performances throughout the film.  Among them are Robert Duvall reprising his role as the loyal, but wary, 'adopted brother' Tom Hagen; Lee Strasberg (the creator of \"method acting\") as Michael's nefarious business partner, Hyman Roth (and target of Michael's famous phrase, \"Keep your friends close, but your enemies even closer\"); and John Cazale as the weak, easily-manipulated Fredo Corleone who gets himself into trouble way over his head.  Few sequels are able to match the acclaim and accomplishment of their predecessor, but \"The Godfather, Part II\" manages to achieve this in epic fashion.  While I still hold to my claim that the original \"Godfather\" was the better of the two films, there is no doubt in my mind that this exists as one of the 10 best films of all-time.", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[15, 17], :date=>" 2003 February 12", :title=>"Epic Sequel that is Equal to original", :location=>"(Silver Spring, MD)", :username=>"Patrick L.

Just as compelling as the first one and in some ways even better.  This is the work of a more mature and focused director, Coppola had grown a  lot as a filmmaker since the first `Godfather' film. More ambitious,  focused, dark and just as powerful and enthralling. It lacks the nostalgia  from the first film, but then this is a much darker film with more ground  to cover. Pacino is truly mesmerizing as the now power-hungry Michael  Corleone, he created one of the most famous and compelling characters in  film history. His performance here is much more complex than in the first  one, Michael goes through one of the most astonishing psychological  transformations of any character in film history. In one of his definitive  roles, Pacino delivers one of the key performances of the 70's and  certainly the best in his career. Just a impressive is Robert DeNiro as  Vito Corleone as a young man, Coppola couldn't have said it better `I saw  DeNiro maybe not as Marlon Brando as a young man but Vito Corleone as a  young man'. DeNiro is best remembered for his roles in Scorsese's pictures  but his performance in this film is almost just as good and ranks among his  best. Virtuoso acting at it's best and even more impressive is that he  mastered the Italian language. Robert Duvall is also great as Tom Hagen,  even though he gets no big scenes. John Cazale's character Fredo Corleone,  who played a small part in the first one, was further developed in this  film. Cazale is as efficient a he can be as Fredo and the scene where  Michael tells Fredo he doesn't want to see him anymore is simply  spellbinding, among the best scenes ever filmed. Talia Shire's character  Connie was also further developed and has some great scenes, namely when he  asks Michael to forgive Fredo, a coldly calculated scene that features  bravura directing by Coppola and showcases his talents at their best. Diane  Keaton also gets a great scene where she tells Michael about the abortion,  another powerhouse scene. Lee Strasberg, who was also one of the most  celebrated acting teachers in the world, agreed to star as Hyman Roth, a  meticulously calculated performance but expect no less from one of the  great acting masters. Michael V. Gazzo is brilliant as Pentangeli, a  supporting performance that well deserves to be compared with DeNiro's or  Strasberg's. Filled with as many memorable supporting characters as in the  first one, I will name only a few: Senator Pat Geary (G.D. Spradlin),  Fanucci (Gastone Moschin), young Clemenza (Bruno Kirby), Johnny Ola  (Dominic Chianese), Al Neri (Richard Bright) are only a few. Th direction  by Coppola is truly masterful. What makes the `Godfather' films the  timeless classics that they are is that they have so many great scenes.  There's never a scene put of place, not a bum performance in the whole cast  and near flawless directing, acting and writing. And `The Godfather Part  II' has more that it's share of great scenes, so many memorable lines and  so many classic scenes it's hard to name them all. This time the score was  by Coppola's father Carmine Coppola. He took the nostalgic theme of Nino  Rota's original score and added a darker tone to it. The score is dazzling  and fits perfectly into this classic film. The screenplay is masterful in  itself. The script is an original screenplay but still it won the Oscar for  best `Adapted Screenplay', but then again the competition was heavy with  the Original Screenplays that year including Robert Towne's script for  `Chinatown', which is a milestone. And to top it all off, the movie ends  with one of the most deeply haunting endings ever filmed, with a close shot  of a grayed-hair Michael dealing with his ghosts. `The Godfather Part II',  along with the first `Godfather' ranks right on top among the best films  ever made. And this is a more complex and dark film, less nostalgic of  course but more professional and focused. A unique treat that should be  tasted by every filmgoer and cherished by all who love great movies.  Extras: Danny Aiello, who would later play the Don in Puzo's `The Last  Don', a much weaker film, appears in a small cameo. From a scale of 1-10 I  give this film a 10!

:emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}]}, {:content=>"In Francis Ford Coppola's cleverly written sequel, The Godfather, Part II, the audience is shown through flashbacks the differences between the two heads of the family, Vito and Michael. The movie begins in 1901 with Vito being a child with his mother begging for his life in Sicily right after his father and brother were killed. Vito narrowly escapes that dark Sicilian scene after his mother's death to an overwhelmingly bright America. The lighting in the scenes, especially the first and last, help portray the deeper, more emotional side of the Corleone family. The scene in Sicily was made out to be a dark place full of deceit, where as when Vito first came to America it was extremely bright- a symbol for hope and goodness. Vito worked hard for the American dream, but remembered his Italian heritage. In this part it was made clear why it was so important to Vito in the original to have friendship because many people helped him out when he first arrived in the United States. Vito worked hard to become what he became while earning the respect of many.  The history of Vito is intertwined with that of Michael's life in 1958. As Michael loses more and more family members he changes for the worse. He lives for a life of action and reaction in the world of revenge. This is such a major change from the first film. Who would have thought that Michael would have turned out the way that he did? To change from a respectable military man who fought valiantly for his country to the head of the Corleone mafia family. Another strong theme in this movie was the loyalty issue. Everyone thought that they could double cross Michael and get away with it because didn't truly earn the position of \"Don,\" it was just bestowed upon him by his father. That in its own respect made Michael turn out to be a little unforgiving. The acting in this film was truly superior to any other movie out there. Talia Shire played the part of Connie Corleone phenomenally. In a scene near the beginning where she is asking Michael for money you can feel her uneasiness. The part of Tom Hagen was a tricky one because throughout the whole movie you aren't sure what side anyone is on(especially Tom) and Robert Duvall played it perfectly. John Cazale played Fredo Corleone, the imbecile who no matter how hard he tried, couldn't get a thing right. First he makes you laugh, then he makes you hate him, then he makes you feel sorry for him. The role of Kay Corleone is played by Diane Keaton who gives a better performance than in the first. This can be plainly seen in every scene that she has with Michael because you can actually feel her pain. Robert De Niro plays the young Vito and does it with a lot of spunk, there is no doubt this man is an Oscar winner. The best performance of the whole movie is that of Al Pacino playing the ever changing role of Michael Corleone. Pacino proves he is a very versatile actor changing from warm, honest, and loyal in the original to cold, unforgiving, and suspicious in the second.

:emphasis=>2.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}]}, {:content=>"Despite its status as arguably the best movie sequel of all time, \"The Godfather: Part II\" is in some ways quite formulaic.  Following a rigid template he set up in \"The Godfather: Part I\", Francis Ford Coppola has once again fashioned a story that begins with a festival, features a failed attempt on the Don's life, and offers as a turning point the murder of an untouchable power figure.  It repeats successful motifs, and, while being less easily quotable, is composed of a very specific kind of language that lets you know the world into which you've entered.The biggest difference, though, is the inclusion of flashbacks to Vito Corleone's early life.  These scenes, taken from Mario Puzo's original novel, let Coppola indulge an idea he had for another movie, to tell parallel stories of a father and a son at the same age.  Far from an indulgence, though, these scenes do wonders in terms of fleshing out the history of the Corleone family.  It drapes a more tragic pall over the story, for it becomes clear that Michael Corleone's fate, one that robs him of his soul and leaves him alone and heartbroken, could not have been avoided.Robert De Niro plays young Vito.  When his job at a local grocery is given to the nephew of the neighbourhood boss, one Don Fanucci, Vito must turn to crime to support his family.  The scenes with Fanucci, played with broad flair by Gastone Moschin, are impressive.  For despite the power and style and fear embodied by the older man, Vito always looks to be in control.  Much of the credit should go to De Niro, who was at the time shifting his career into a higher gear that would eventually lead him to Travis Bickle.  He is at his best here when the scene calls for silence, displaying a whimsical grace that hides his violent nature.  When he opens his mouth to speak it sounds an awful lot like the kind of Marlon-Brando-as-The-Godfather impression you've heard a million times.If the flashback scenes didn't mesh perfectly with the contemporary scenes, Coppola's little gimmick would seem redundant.  Using a variety of devices, the past and the present mesh perfectly into one movie.The other half of the movie, set in the late-1950s and early-1960s, is epic in scope where the first half was small and personal.  Despite the globetrotting antics of the story, it's still a tale of one individual's road to perdition.Without his father and brother around to steal the spotlight, Michael Corleone firmly establishes himself as the key piece of \"The Godfather\" puzzle.  Gone, however, is the innocent Joe College of the first film, replaced by a detached and Machiavellian man.  He's reached the top of the mountain, only to find it a place cold enough to freeze your heart, and lonely enough that you must look inward for solace.  It is the internal nature of Michael's character that defines how this story will be told.  Many of the killings are hidden, obstructed.  \"Part I\" featured elaborate homicidal set-pieces, each culminating in a charismatic and compelling murder.  \"Part II\" does no such thing.  Instead of allowing us to see the bullet enter the eye, or the piano wire go around the neck, we get one murder partially hidden by wind-blown drapery, an attempted smothering that takes place behind closed doors, a suicide shown only in aftermath tableau, and finally a judicious edit, cutting away from the horrible act, to reveal who is really being destroyed by the final killing.  Coppola, whose desire to make a personal film is more evident here than in \"Part I\" (which is, in comparison, almost a popcorn gobbling blockbuster), exhibits artful taste in the way he tells the story.A story, which rides on the shoulders of Al Pacino.  His portrayal of Michael Corleone, to me, is his best work.  It is the template for every great performance he will give in its wake: quiet, brooding, and all the while repressing the vaunted Pacino rage.  The Michael Corleone of \"Part II\" is a more mysterious man, a less joyous man, and a more vengeful man.Despite Michael's (and Al's) ascension to prominence, I always find Fredo to be a more intriguing character.  Relegated to a few undignified scenes in \"Part I\", Fredo doesn't come off much better here.  He's still the simplest of the Corleone boys, a condition now explained by a childhood sickness in the flashback scenes.  But despite his deficiencies it is Fredo, knowingly or otherwise, who comes closest to taking The Godfather down.  John Cazale, who played Fredo, does a remarkable job portraying the man's joie de vivre, his melancholy, and his self-awareness.  In Cazale's hands Fredo knows that he will never reach the heights of his brothers, a fact that more or less defines his existence.  \"You're my kid brother,\" he incredulously tells Michael, \"and you take care of me?\"A couple of newcomers are added to the mix, livening up an already tasty stew.  Michael V. Gazzo, as underboss Frankie Pentangeli, brings a welcome dose of humour and brashness to the proceedings.  His distinctive voice and broad gesticulations make him a wonderful character to watch.  The other newcomer who makes his mark is legendary acting teacher Lee Strasberg, who plays Hyman Roth.  Sickly and old, Strasberg still manages to imbue Roth with a sense of the man's former vitality, and his current bulldogedness.  Strasberg never makes bold choices (as opposed to Gazzo, who is all bold choices), but his quiet tenacity is a perfect match for the same quality Pacino brings to Michael.At well over 3 hours long, \"The Godfather: Part II\" would be a torturous chore if it weren't such a fully-packed delight.  Every scene is relevant to the plot, suspenseful, and wonderfully artistic.  Coppola had an arduous task in trying to top the first \"Godfather\".  While less overtly crowd-pleasing and propulsive, I'd say he pulled it off just fine.", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[13, 17], :date=>" 2002 August 18", :title=>"A Sequel That Will Break Your Heart", :location=>"", :username=>"Mike Stone", :source=>{:vendor=>"amazon", :url=>"http://www.amazon.com/The-Godfather-Part-II-Restoration/product-reviews/B0019L21GA"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"Despite its status as arguably the best movie sequel of all time, \"The Godfather: Part II\" is in some ways quite formulaic.", :clean_text=>"despite its status as arguably the best movie sequel of all time the godfather part ii is in some ways quite formulaic.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"Following a rigid template he set up in \"The Godfather: Part I\", Francis Ford Coppola has once again fashioned a story that begins with a festival, features a failed attempt on the Don's life, and offers as a turning point the murder of an untouchable power figure.", :clean_text=>"following a rigid template he set up in the godfather part i francis ford coppola has once again fashioned a story that begins with a festival features a failed attempt on the don's life and offers as a turning point the murder of an untouchable power figure.", :sentiment=>-2, :context_tags=>{:plot=>100}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>["Francis Ford Coppola"], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>2, :text=>"It repeats successful motifs, and, while being less easily quotable, is composed of a very specific kind of language that lets you know the world into which you've entered.The biggest difference, though, is the inclusion of flashbacks to Vito Corleone's early life.", :clean_text=>"it repeats successful motifs and while being less easily quotable is composed of a very specific kind of language that lets you know the world into which you've entered.the biggest difference though is the inclusion of flashbacks to vito corleone's early life.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{:dialog=>70}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>["Robert De Niro"], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>3, :text=>"These scenes, taken from Mario Puzo's original novel, let Coppola indulge an idea he had for another movie, to tell parallel stories of a father and a son at the same age.

Partly taken from Mario Puzo's novel and partly original (Coppola and Puzo share screenplay credit), this three hour and 20 minute combination gangster epic and Americana saga takes us from 1901 Ellis Island to Lake Tahoe in the late 1950s.  We open with the child Vito Corleone (who will grow up to be the Brando patriarch of the 1972 film) fleeing Sicily after his mother and brother are assassinated.  Vito arrives safely at Ellis Island.Cut to sun-drenched Lake Tahoe with Vito's adult son Michael (Al Pacino in the performance of his career to date) hosting one of the most lavish and romantic wedding parties in movie history.  But then we cut inside the boathouse, where sinister actions and killings are being planned by Michael and G.D. Spradlin as the oily Nevada governor.  The Corleones want a controlling interest in Vegas and Tahoe gambling.  Note the fabulous Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola music outside in the bright sunshine contrasted by ace cinematographer Gordon Willis' use of dark shadows and low light inside.  (Location filming was done at the beautiful Getty Estate on the deep blue lake.  I heard a terribly sad story that Willis was denied two Oscar nominations for GODFATHER I and II because the old guard inside the cinematography guild thought he was a youthful student who did not know to turn up the lighting!  He finally got nominated for GODFATHER III after people in the Academy realized he was a maestro with light and shadow and color quality.)Throughout the immense and hugely engrossing 200 minute running time of GODFATHER II, Coppola and  three credited film editors (Barry Malkin, Peter Zinner, and Richard Marks) cut back and forth between the young Vito Corleone  (an Oscar-winning Robert De Niro speaking only Sicilian with subtitles) in 1910's Little Italy; and his son Michael involved in gambling from 1950's Tahoe  to Miami to the Dominican Republic.  Linking the material is the last scene in the distant past, as Michael kills the mafioso who murdered his father's mother in the opening scene.  I really wish there could be a GODFATHER IV to show how the young Michael leaving Sicily in 1930 became Vito Corleone's adult son in the 1945 Brooklyn of the opening scene of the first movie.  What happened to the Corleone family during the Depression and World War Two?  When you see the first two movies recut chronologically, there is a gaping continuity hole here.Dean Tavoularis' production design and Theodora Van Runkle's costumes are stupendous, capturing both the 1910's Little Italy and the myriad 1950's locales.  Tavoularis re-decorated existing streets in lower Manhattan to look like the 1910-1930 era, then took on the challenge of Miami and Cuba in the 1950's, including a lavish hotel party with fabulous music by, I think, Carmine Coppola; Carmine did the incidental music, while Nino Rota did the incomparable background score.  And cinematographer Gordon Willis, one of the world's great lighting cameramen, sets up stunning visual contrasts between sepia and gas-lit Little Italy, and sun-drenched Tahoe and Cuba.  I do not have enough praise for everyone who made this movie, on both sides of the camera.  It is certainly helpful to have Francis Coppola's audio commentary identifying all of the background character actors and noting how smoothly the mammoth 104 day shoot all over the world went, in contrast to the disastrous first film behind the scenes.Diane Keaton and Robert Duvall do not get enough credit in this review.  They add a lot of flavoring, Keaton as Michael's second wife until a brutal flare-up 2/3 of the way through; and Duvall as the family lawyer.  Watch GODFATHER: PART THREE (1990), where Duvall's absence is sorely missed (contract negotiation matters) and Keaton is back on good terms with Michael.  Pacino's Michael in Part Two rots before our eyes, especially if you watch the two lengthy films on DVD on two consecutive evenings.  At the end of Part One, Michael has his sister's (Talia Shire) husband murdered.  In Part Two, Shire is heavily rouged with furs and endless cigarettes.  And Michael has brother Fredo (the neglected and excellent John Cazale, who died much too young in real life) killed in a boat on an Autumn Lake Tahoe.It's a titanic film, maybe one of my five favorites in the American cinema, and Coppola's masterpiece among masterpieces.  I haven't even mentioned Michael V. Gazzo, playwright turned actor as a nervous Mafia hood named Frankie  Plantagalee; and legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg as a fictional version of Meyer Lansky, who wants to live in retirement in Miami with his wife.  Both Gazzo and Strasberg got Supporting Actor Oscar nominations, playing vivid characters who will not survive to the ending credits.This enthralling, and admittedly very violent in spots (especially the final reel) gangster film/Americana epic ends where it really began--at the Getty Estate on Lake Tahoe.  It is Autumn with an empty lake and lots of leaves on the ground.  Michael has had everyone else killed one by one and is all alone in a chair, pensive, ponderng his whole life.  The first movie was made only two years earlier, in 1972, but Michael seems a good thirty years older here.  Cue Nino Rota's incomparable music score after maybe a full minute of silence, then a longer than usual black fadeout, then roll the end credits.  Man, I adore this movie!  Please, please, do not stay away from it because of the violence--and for heaven's sake take two nights if you need two nights for the 200 minute length.  THE GODFATHER: PART  TWO is one for the ages, a motion picture that everyone connected with can be extraordinarily proud of, now and forever.

It is in a sense a voyeuristic\ndelight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of\nthe family. It single-handedly change the world's view of organized crime,\nand created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of\ncommon morality. It was the highest grossing movie of its time and Brando\ncreated a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it\ndid\nin 1972.As extraordinary an achievement as this is, Part II is even better. It\neasily receives my nod as the best picture ever made. I have seen it at\nleast 20 times, and each time its 200 minutes fly by.The movie uses flashbacks to brilliantly weave two tales. The main story\nis\nthe reign of Michael Corleone as the world's most powerful criminal. Now\nreaping the benefits of legalized gambling in Las Vegas, Michael is an\nevident billionaire with an iron fist on a world of treachery.Behind this, Director Francis Ford Coppola spins the tale of the rise of\nMichael's father, Vito, to the center of the New York mafia. It is these\nscenes that make the film a work of art. Without spoiling, I will simply\nsay\nthe Robert DeNiro as the young Vito is the best acting performance of all\ntime, a role  for which he won a richly deserved Oscar.The screenplay is full of delicious little underworld nuggets (\"Keep your\nfriends close .....\", \"I don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies\"),\nwhile it blows a dense, twisted plot past you at a dizzying and merciless\npace. The cinematography is depressing and atmospheric. The score\ncontinues\nin the eerie role of its predecessor, foretelling death and\nevil.All of this makes the movie great and infinitely watchable. But it's\nwhat's\ndeeper inside this film ... what it is really about ... that is its true\ngenius.The Godfather Part II is not really a movie about the mafia, it is a movie\nabout a man's life long struggle. Michael controls a vast empire that is\nconstantly slipping out of his hands. He grows increasingly distrustful\nand\nparanoid, and even shows signs that he hates his own life. Michael almost\nseems to resent the fact that he is a natural born crime lord, a man who\nputs the family business ahead of everything.The great Don Michael Corleone can never come to terms with one simple\nfact.... his father's empire was built on love and respect, Michael's empire\nis\nbuilt on fear and violent treachery.See this movie.

This is a direct continuation of that\nstory.The good news is that The Godfather Part II has many amazing qualities,\nincluding fantastic performances from a superb cast, sublime,\nunprecedented visuals that no one else has been able to capture since,\nand very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily\nbeen a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't\npossibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets\ntranscend what's basically a mess overall. Because it should have been\na 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at\nlength, I may pick on more things in my review than you would think I\nwould for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, The Godfather\nPart II is still essential viewing.Director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola cleverly begins the film with\nparallels to The Godfather. We see Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) \"in the\nrole\" of his father, Vito (Marlon Brando), from the first film,\naccepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. Like\nthe first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know\nsome of the principal characters. Perhaps during this segment, perhaps\na bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn't so clever after\nall, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The\nGodfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario\nPuzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.After the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we\nquickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone's mafia\nworld. Michael believes that someone on the \"inside\" was involved with\nthe hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has\nMichael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New\nYork, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the\nattempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all\nbeen part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one\nof the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn't convey Michael's\nunderlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not\nthrough his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set-up, it\nstarts to feel like slightly muddled writing.During the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also\nhave a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast.\nThere are bit too many characters who aren't well enough presented or\nexplained. You may need to keep a scorecard.Coppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended \"flashback\" segments,\nand I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert\nDe Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although\nmaybe that's a bit of my bias creeping in, as I'm a huge De Niro fan.But let's talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl. This is maybe\nfirst evident in the flashbacks. As good as they are, they go on far\ntoo long, and happen far too frequently, to sustain the momentum of\neither the Michael story or the Vito-as-a-youngster story. It begins to\nfeel like we're toggling back and forth between two films, which is the\ntrack that should have been taken. The prequel, at least, would have\nbeen a solid 10.There's also a lot of sprawl in the Michael Corleone segments. Coppola\nappears to have been suffering from what I'd now call \"J.K. Rowling\nSyndrome\". That happens when an artist becomes successful enough that\nthey can fire or ignore their editor(s). Instead of taking good advice\nabout where to trim fat, the artist decides to just leave much of it\nin, and they now have the clout to override any dissenting and more\nsensible opinions. The Michael Corleone story has a lot of fat,\nincluding much of the Cuba material (for example, sitting around the\ntable with the President, laboriously passing around a solid gold\ntelephone), the Senate hearings (which go on far too long to make and\nprovide the dramatic points), and so on.The film begins to feel more like a couple seasons of a television show\nthat Coppola tried to cram into a 3 and a half hour film, or worse, a\ncollection of deleted scenes. The scenes, except for the fat that\nneeded to be trimmed, are excellent in isolation. But by the time the\nclimax rolls around, the whole has more of an arbitrary feeling--this\nis especially clear in the dénouement, which seems to just end.I've barely left myself room to talk about the good points. The first\none, which most people mention, is the acting. There isn't a bad\nperformance in the film, but Pacino, De Niro, and some relatively minor\ncharacters, like those played by Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John\nCazale, really stand out.The second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the\nbeautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production\ndesign is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit\nscenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness,\nand everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange.\nAmazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly\ndifficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I can't\nremember another film since that has been able to capture the same\nlook.

to this point, if there is one thing I despise it would have to be sequels. Now, for those that are new, the reason why is simple: sequels next to never live up to their potential and end up destroying the story that the original had created. Well, this film does not destroy nor surpasses The Godfather. Instead, it is more like a continuation of an already great tale, giving us the back story on Vito (played by a then unknown RObert De Niro) and the destruction of Michael (played by already Academy Award winner Al Pacino) in a rather original way to tell both stories: show through out the film both sides as they happen at once. Now, as most people know, I love the beloved original film and I was a little worried about my taste with this film. I already knew that it won a slew of Academy Awards (including the award for best film; a first for a sequel) and people have had the audacity to say that this is the better film in Francis Ford Coppola's epic Crime saga. My opinion after watching this film is that, if I had to guess where it would rank among the three films, I would have to say that it would be almost tied to the original. The main reason is this: The original had a feel of being welcomed into this world. Through the opening shots of Vito Corleone talking to his friend on the day of his daughter's wedding, we are welcomed with cold arms into their world. With this film however, you are just thrown in without any mercy. You are shown the blunt world where everyone is guilty of something and no one is innocent (except the children Marianna Hill as Deanna Corleone) and you are left cold and isolated as you look into the past and present of the Corleone crime family. But what really makes this film stand out would have to be how much all of the characters have changed from the previous film. For Michael, he goes from being a bright young man to a ruthless, heartless, cold bastard that destroys everything in his way to his sister Connie who has become something of a complete tramp and a neglectful mother. Due to how these characters change, you get the feeling that this film would be better due to their development. But, as I have said, it is mostly due to the feel of this film that makes the original a tad bit better. But, ignoring that aspect, this film is a perfect follow up to the original classic. Now for the details. With directing, Coppola shows us that he is no where near tired yet as he directs this entire masterpiece. Now, the thing that caught me off guard with this film would have to be the slew of emotions I felt while watching this film. If there is one thing that Coppola can do is make his audience feel for the characters. He allows them to build up, grow,  and when two particular scenes near the end begin, you can not help but feel like you are about to burst into tears due to how desperate one character is, and the actions and heartache another one shows us. Coppola is a master behind a camera, and this film might be his directorial masterpiece (next to The Godfather and Apocalypse Now). With acting, oh wow. Where do I begin with this one. Might as well start with the men of this film. Okay, first person to mention is Al Pacino in his award winning role as Michael Corelone. After already winning an Academy Award for that role when he was in the original, I am still impressed at how he was able to move the character through out this story. He made the character barbaric, evil, and just plain unlikable, but his acting made him likable as well. Just, Pacino breathed life into this character and allowed him to take control in so many ways it was unreal. After this film was made, he won another Academy Award for this film and I must say: it was well earned. Next is Robert De Niro portraying Vito Corleone. As most people know about this film, it goes back and forth between Michael's life and Vito's life and for Vito, we have a then unknown actor filling in the shoes of Marlon Brando. Now, that alone is difficult as hell to do, considering how great Brando was and how iconic he made the character. Now, my reaction to this performance was that I am impressed with the bravery alone that De Niro had for this performance. He portrayed the younger Vito with such power and authority that he would of made Brando proud. He was just that good. Now, De Niro would go on the receive the Academy Award for Best Supporting actor, and for this film he deserves it. If you are a fan of De Niro's work, then this is a good place to start for learning about his career. Now you have Robert Duvall as the ever loyal Tom Hagen. Personally, I like how he was able to keep cool during some rather intense scenes that deal with Michael's decent into pure hell. Duvall gives it his all in this film and he was wonderful. Now we must get down to the three women who took over this film. The first would have to be Diane Keaton as Amy Corleone. When we last saw her, we saw the look of shame and disgust that was on her face when she realized how much Michael has lied to her. In this film, she wants out. How badly does she want to get out? So bad that she does the unthinkable in one scene and makes it out to be something different that is all part of her plan. Now, Keaton had to play a complete different character in this film and seeing her new way of handling this character, I will admit that it was shocking and reveling in terms of her pure talent to act. She is an incredible actress and she is wonderful. Next would have to be Marianna Hill as Deanna Corleone. In the first film, Marianna had very little screen time as she was not that important to the story. Here, she plays a much larger role and has one of the most somber scenes in this film. She makes the character out to be more then a sweet old lady, she makes the character out to be an intelligent, thoughtful, and wise person who helps Michael when he is left with a terrible thought that nearly destroys him. Lastly Talia Shire as Connie. Like most females in the first film, here she shines as a totally different character. What makes her worthy is how she makes herself out to be this tramp that just does not care about her family, hates her brother, and abandons her children. Connie transformed in one of the worst ways possible, but we love Shire for making the character so damn wonderful to watch. Next up is the script. One thing that needs to be stressed is that this film's script was only half written from the original novel by Mario Puzo. The other half was written by him and Coppola, but it was mostly original. Personally, I did not think that the story needed to be continued, but having the original creator there to do the work, the script became a clever, emotionally charged epic that is bound to catch a few people off guard. Fantastic work here. Lastly the score. Getting Nina Rota back again, the score is longer, has more music cues, and is just fun to listen to. The best tracks appear during the flashback scenes in the film while the msot dramatic happen in the present day parts. But, what I like about it is just how creative it gets with the music and how it moves from the beginning to the end. The entire time, we are eclipsed with the wonders of it's notes that the music becomes a comfort in so many scenes. Then again, the score did win the award for best original score, so that should say something. Overall, this is an emotional film that is worthy of it's original and works well as a stand alone in some respects.", :title=>nil, :location=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"rotten_tomatoes",

It was considered a masterpiece and the story was amazing. Along with a great cast, the movie never seemed too long for its 3 hour run time.\r\rIn 1974, the sequel was revealed . . . \r\rThe Godfather Part II is known as the greatest sequel made in film making history. 200 minute (3 hours and 20 minutes) run time and a dark story filled the movie theaters. We all knew when the famous score from the first movie came on, we were in for a treat . . . and it was amazing.\r\rThe Godfather Part II switches between present time with Michael Corleone (Al Pacino in a riveting performance) taking control of the gambling in the country and young Vito Corleone's (Robert DeNiro, spot on) climb to power in New York's Lower East Side. But first Michael:\r\rMichael Corleone has moved to Nevada where he begins to take over all the gambling in the country. As his son's, Anthony, communion party he is confronted by a Senator where Michael is insulted and forced to buy the gambling license for $250,000. But Michael keeps his cool and respectfully says, \"Senator? You can have my answer now, if you like. My final offer is this: nothing. Not even the fee for the gaming license, which I would appreciate if you would put up personally.\" - right there we realize that Michael means business and prepare for a lot of it. That night, his bedroom is sprayed over with bullets as Michael crawls over to the other side of the bed to protect Kay (Diane Keaton) and her baby. This is where we find out that this movie is going to be one hell of a ride. Michael believes it could be Frank Pentangeli, a loud mouth who feels mistreated by Michael, or Hyman Roth, a sick but powerful man who controls the gambling in Miami.\r\rBut this is only half of the story . . .\r\rThe other half follows young Vito as he suffers through the murders of his father, brother Paolo and mother by the Don in Corleone. We watch him secretly taken to a boat to travel to the United States through Elis Island. There we watch him grow from a worker at a local Italian Deli to a powerful man in New York City. How he gets there is the most important part. While he is a business man in most of the scenes he isn't scared to get his hands dirty sometimes. In the end, he returns to Italy for one that \"chore\" to finish up.\r\rThese two stories (while the movie mainly follows Michael's empire) juxtapose each other. On one side, the movie shows Vito climb to power as a business man and helpful to his neighborhood, but on the other, the movie shows Michael's descent into Hell so-to-speak. Unlike his father, who even says, \"We are not murderers\", Michael isn't afraid to wipe people out during his time as \"Don\" of his empire. As Michael says to Tom, \"Tom, you know you surprise me. If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone.\" This is one of many quotes that Michael shouts out in the movie. The movie shines in the shadows of Michael's dark mind. After you have seen the movie, you have no idea which things Michael said were actually true. The truth is very hard to find in this film and that is one of its many fantastic characteristics.\r\rThe film also comes with its fair share of shocks. Without spitting anything out, this movie will shock you in at least three scenes - all of which are memorable. One scene in particular with Kay and Michael is full of anger and shock that many will feel uncomfortable watching based on it's dialogue. The dialogue in this film is tremendous - probably better than the first film. You have the famous quote, \"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse\" in the movie but many others, one of which I have written in the paragraph above. Others are just brilliantly made. Each sentence of dialogue supports or creates the dark scenes within this film.\r\rThe cast in the movie is outstanding yet again. Al Pacino is excellent as Michael Corleone. He was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role in 1974 and didn't win. (NOTE: If there is one performance that Al Pacino should have won for, it has to be this film. He is amazing!). Diane Keaton is great as Michael's pregnant wife, Robert Duvall as Tom Harper is outstanding as usual, and Robert DeNiro as Vito Corleone is tremendous as he won Best Supporting Actor for this role.\r\rSay what you want about the first film whether it is a classic or its a masterpiece but let this be certain: The Godfather Part II might be better. In my opinion, not only is it the greatest sequel ever made, but it is even better than Part I. The violence is intenser, the story is darker, the performances are more riveting than Part I, and the run time is longer. The Godfather Part II is Best Picture of 1974 and once again it is well deserved.\r\rThis is Michael Corleone's descent into Hell throughout the movie. He becomes a monster and if you look back at how Michael actually got to this point, you will be amazed on how he has changed. The movie ends with Michael thinking back to when he told his family that he enlisted in the Marines and how upset they were. It begins with Michael in his father's chair but not following his father's footsteps. If you watch this movie for the first time I want you to picture the first time you meet Michael in Part I - then press play. At the end, you should see a drastic change as if Michael is two people.\r\rIf there is anything that Michael will try to teach you as you watch this amazing film it is this, \"There are many things my father taught me here in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.\"", :title=>nil, :location=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"rotten_tomatoes", :url=>"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/godfather_part_ii/"},

The Godfather gets just about everything right in this compelling masterpiece that will be forever remembered and emulated, the godfather of modern films.

Al Pacino and Marlon Brando give stellar performances in their greatest movie ever. The amount of emotion in The Godfather is amazing too as the you clearly feel each character's emotion and are drawn into it. The moments staying forever in your mind because it is so amazing. The Godfather reinvents the way I look at movies, my view of them has changed forever as I see how masterful this film is. It crushes every other film, no other film will ever come close to knocking The Godfather off its pedestal of greatness. Flaws, this sounds mundane but I cannot say it any other way, there are like ZERO flaws in the film. I scrutinized but could not find any at all. The good aspects deeply mask the film's bad aspects so a perfect movie has been created in a sense, that is amazing. I have not given a movie a perfect 10 out of 10, I have not seen a movie worthy of the all-time high but that changes with The Godfather and it is well deserved.

Each and every scene of the film is carefully filmed to create a whole different world for the viewer to get involved in, these scenes are intense, personal, but most importantly, completely focused on who is onscreen, each character has their moment, and they each make their mark on this legendary film. Perhaps the man who left the biggest mark was Marlon Brando, who plays the titular character, an underworld crime family boss who we are introduced to as an over the shoulder view, he scratches his face with the back of his fingers, he rolls his eyes, strokes his cat and talks in a muffled tone, all through the brilliance of Brando, who used cotton wool to perfect the speech, and rolled with a cat running on set, something not scripted, but perfect for the character Brando created, the everlasting memory of Vito Corleone, a man that when he opens his mouth, a respectable silence falls upon the film, acting at its best.

This business is told as a memorable reflection from Michael, played in perfectly calm but conflicted fashion by Al Pacino, who is the family member not quite sure what he wants, not part of the business, but suited for it. We are immediately thrust into the struggles of each crime family as they attempt to get stakes in a new market, something which Vito refuses to be a part of, put also something that almost costs him his life. With this, the eldest and hot-headed son steps forward, Sonny (James Caan) who ignores the wishes of the consigliere Tom (Robert Duvall) and seeks revenge on those who wronged his family. In the midst of all this there is a warming tone of a film, with some truly touching performances and some unforgettable turns as gangsters in 1940s New York. James Caan is well casted as the good-naturedbut short-tempered Sonny, who wants power, but also seems to want whats best for most of his family. But its Al Pacino and Marlon Brando who excel the film to remarkable achievements, Brando creates a character that simply couldn't be replicated or remade, and Pacino plays a conflicted but right-minded youngest brother, he gets what he wants and Pacino shows excellence in his eyes and confident speaking. A true journey of emotion, heartache, acceptance and love, the film explores all areas of what it means to be true to oneself, but also to forgive and forget, this is a truly remarkable feat and a masterful film that has given us some of the most memorable characters we have ever known, but also set a standard in the film industry as a force to be reckoned with, even as the years since its release tick on.", :useful=>[0.0, 0], :username=>"StevenF", :date=>"Aug  7, 2013", :location=>nil, :title=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"metacritic", :url=>"http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-godfather"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"Films like The Godfather are the reason i have a lifelong passion and love for film.", :clean_text=>"films like the godfather are the reason i have a lifelong passion and love for film.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"A combination of writing, acting, cinematography and a thoroughly engrossing plot have undoubtedly created one of the greatest pieces of cinema, point blank.

It's a great story, with a superstar cast, which set the genre for all the mafia films that followed, but that in and of itself means the film is going to have problems. As with other mafia films, it's difficult to keep track of who's who in the large cast. It also moves rather quickly and viewers like myself are going to have a very difficult time of trying to follow the erratic timeline of the film. Some parts move at a snails pace, while other just fly by, and what is with the music? The soundtrack is almost as acclaimed as the film, but honestly if I had to hear that song one more time, during this three hour epic, I may have gone out and killed someone myself. For those unfamiliar with the story, it follows the evolution of the Corleone family, as they transition from one leader to the next. The story is fantastic and is the furthest thing from predictable that you will ever find. It is filed with classic scenes and renowned performance from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, but I really have a hard time calling such a complicated story with that much violence, the best of all-time.

Alliances are formed in secret, murders are plotted, enemies are butchered or blown to pieces without remorse.Inspired by the Five Families of New York City, The Godfather tells the story of how the Corleones are pushed against the wall by their rivals and other upcoming gangsters who want to make money by sources Don Vito deems beneath him, and their retaliation and its consequences. Alliances are formed in secret, murders are plotted, enemies are butchered or blown to pieces without remorse. Don Vito (Marlon Brando) and his sons Sonny (James Caan) and Michael (Al Pacino) are the main characters. The actors bringing them to life have succeeded in their jobs so supremely that these characters have become the stuff of legend. Don Vito's backstory from the novel was pushed into The Godfather Part II, and that was a practical decision as the movie was already three hours long. Sonny and Michael display their acumen for running criminal activities when the reins are handed to them in their turn. Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is the consigliere, or the most trusted adviser, of the Don. We are transported from 1940s NYC ripe with Mafia bosses one-upping each other, to Sicily and Las Vegas. The characters are never shown to traverse great expanses of land or sea in search of destiny or whatever. Neither are they shown to be engaging in life-or-death situations where they have to come out on top using their wits or physical strength or endurance. But the change of settings does meet the requirements of the epic genre. Even though we don't get to see large scale gunfights or something like that, the fact that the Corleones are in all these places helps to form that opinion. The story is essentially about a single family, and you get the impression that the message here is that family is important, and that the lengths you're willing to go to to protect them knows no bounds. The Corleones' peace is fazed when a gangster offers them a deal in drugs. Don Vito expresses his disgust and refuses. This triggers an unexpected ploy for gaining power and upper hand and turns the conflict into a fully fledged gang war. Some characters are displaced, forced to take up arms, or caught in the crossfire. Another calamity strikes when things seem to have cooled down. Finally, the Corleones deal with their enemies effectively and ruthlessly. The victory is theirs, but if it is worth it is for the audience to decide. The Godfather's success lies in its rich story and characters. Often times, great stories come about by accident. The setting complements the plot and the characters, and becoming a character itself, creates a blend that is greater than the sum of its parts. These characters and plot could quite easily have worked in a medieval setting of dynasties warring for control over a kingdom, or any other setting for that matter, but the fact that the setting was New York City and the control over the city meant control over the most lucrative criminal activities, which is a decadent scheme, and immediately paints even the good guys in a bad light, was what in my opinion made The Godfather much more intriguing and enduring. There are many enemies to deal with. The film doesn't develop them at all. The Corleones are the only ones who are explored and developed as characters. At first it seems like it is a story of a group of people who have virtually everything they could ever want and the film would only chronicle their exploits as they vanquish this enemy and that. This changes as we move forward and witness the bloodshed. No good movie can come into being without good plotting, believable characterization, classy cinematography and memorable dialogue, and here it is all brought together nigh perfectly. The production design was impressive. The houses and their interiors, and the cars and costumes were fascinating and left me with a desire to be able to witness that world firsthand. The secondary characters may not have seemed to be given much screen time to develop them but the cast is so huge that if they had done it the movie would have been at least an hour longer. The score is so simple and true to the story that you don't need me to tell you that it may be the most memorable score ever. A lot of time is spent in contemplation and silence, as the characters decide what the best course of action should be in response to a particular problem. The dialogue fleshes out the characters very well. The Godfather is essentially a film that looks into the lives of the gangsters at the top of the hierarchy. We only see the comings and goings, and not the handiwork, of the men who carry out the orders of their bosses. No shootouts during the gang war are shown. The intrigue that directly affects the main characters is in itself so destructive and deadly that not once the exclusion of the ordinary mobsters bother me in any way. The Godfather cannot be dismissed as being merely about a mob family and a bunch of criminals. Given his later career, I think it's safe to venture that Coppola was born to make this movie.", :useful=>[0.0, 0], :username=>"Swati", :date=>"Mar  6, 2014", :location=>nil, :title=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"metacritic", :url=>"http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-godfather"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"Inspired by the Five Families of New York City, The Godfather tells the story of how the Corleones are pushed against the wall by their rivals and other upcoming gangsters who want to make money by sources Don Vito deems beneath him, and their retaliation and its consequences.

Two years later, this film adaptation appeared and I have since seen it (as well as Godfather Part II) more than a dozen times. Francis Ford Coppola deserves all of the praise and awards these films have received over the years. He should also be admired for insisting that Pacino and Brando be cast in two of the major roles despite strong opposition from Paramount. Coppola assembled a superb cast but also an equally talented crew. Those who share my high regard for it no doubt have their own favorite scenes. Mine include Michael's enlistment of a bewildered young man's assistance at the hospital until members of the Corleone family arrive to protect their don, the sequence in the restaurant which results in the killing of Sollozzo and McCluskey, Tom Hagen's discussion with Jack Woltz during dinner, Michael's reunion conversation with Kay as they stroll in a New England village, and the montage of executions during the baptism. None of the extensive violence in the film seems gratuitous. Each major character is fully developed. The cinematography and score are outstanding, although neither was even nominated for an Academy Award. Dark as this film often is, it also has its lighter moments, as during the wedding celebration when Luca Brasi rehearses his remarks before presenting a gift and later when Clemenza teases Michael good-naturedly about Kay Adams. For me, the single most interesting element in the film is Michael's gradual development from his family's baby brother (albeit a war hero) to its ruthlessly efficient don. Once he volunteers to kill Sollozzo and McCluskey, his destiny is assured. In some respects, this film reminds me of an opera but one with a multi-dimensional plot as well as grandeur in its style, scope, and emotional impact.

Any doubt about that can be dispelled by watching the movie. I missed this when it first came out, and then a curious thing happened. For some reason I thought I had seen the film. One decade and then two went by and I kept hearing what a great film The Godfather was. But I was unimpressed because I thought I had seen it.I don't know what film I had seen, but it wasn't The Godfather. Seeing this film for the first time over thirty years after the fact of its production is a startling experience. The Godfather is a work of art from first scene to last. There is the most amazing adherence to that fiction which is truer than fact.I would like to say that I played cards with Mario Puzo who wrote the novel from which the film was adapted and who famously worked with Coppola on the screenplay, but in fact I only played cards with some people who had played cards with Puzo. Ah, such is the effect of celebrity. Puzo became like Coppola something of a legend after this film was produced, and everybody suddenly knew him or played cards with him. Everybody, from the most unsophisticated celluloid fan to the most erudite and jaded critic had walked out of that theater after 171 minutes mesmerized and delighted and emotionally moved by an uncompromising look at not just a Mafia family, but the psychology of families since time immemorial. The truth that we have all lived and experienced was made large on the screen in the form of the Corleones. I can guarantee you that audiences from every culture on the planet would understand the underlying psychology of this movie and take it to some serious extent as their own.Marlon Brando plays the godfather (the patriarch, of course, or even the warlord if you like) of the past and the present, and then, as must always be the case, comes a new godfather. What is fascinating is who this new godfather is and how he comes to power. The ending of the film is--after so many brilliant scenes and so many psychologically true surprises and so many excursions to Queens and the Bronx and Sicily and Las Vegas (each vignette absolutely integrated into the story of the film)--even more ponderously true and a surprise that sneaks up on us so stealthily that it is not a surprise. And when the credits begin to run after Diana Keaton's tears of realization, we too realize the \"message\" of the film. It is a message that I think would be understood in the Middle East today (and two thousand years ago as well) as I write this, a message of tribal ways and the rise and fall of warlords and the Machiavellian machinations of the prince who would be king.But it is Al Pacino's performance as the son of the godfather that in the final analysis steals the show as he goes from the intellectual boy who would be a legitimate American success at the finest colleges, etc. to a man wearing the hat of Al Capone. And Pacino makes us believe every step of the way.Well, I should not say that it Al Pacino who steals the show. In truth this is Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece. He would not have the film he has without Al Pacino or Marlon Brandon and certainly not without the novel and script from Mario Puzo, of course; but make no mistake about it. Coppola manicured every scene. He attended to every detail, from the color of the wine to the tires on the cars to the dances and the music to the villas abroad to the sleaze of Las Vegas to the perfect casting of the main characters right down to the extras including both cute and not so cute kids, as indeed life would give us. In some very real sense Coppola lived this movie and it was a part of him, and yet I am stuck by the fact that Puzo invented it.This is an American classic, an uncompromising work of art that engages, informs and moves the audience--just about any audience--to ask the great questions regarding who we are and what we should do and how we should live. From the wedding to the funeral to the christening to the priest in Latin voice-over as the final vengeance is planned to that final vengeance (that we know will NOT be the final vengeance), we are glued to our seats as the life of human beings (who could very well be us) passes before our transfixed eyes.Oscars went to Brando as best actor, and to Puzo and Coppola for best screen adaptation. In a rare show of almost universal agreement among movie goers, critics, and the Academy, The Godfather won the Oscar as Best Picture in 1972.Don't miss this as I had for so long, and see it for Coppola who can take his place among the greats of all cinema for this film alone.", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[38, 46], :date=>" 2004 November 23", :title=>"One of the best ever

It may not have been the slickest piece of film-making or broke any new ground but it's themes, the importance of family, both biological and professional, resonate to this day.  In this case the families happen to be both Italian-American and Mafia, but that's just incidental.  I've never read the novel that this is based on but it's my understanding that Mario Puzo's book is pulpier than than the film that Francis Ford Coppola made of it.  That is one of the reasons that this film is elevated above all others in that it could have been soapier and glitzier than it was but it did not succumb to that and credit has to be given to Coppola as both screenwriter and director for that.  Coppola emphasized in his script it's most important theme, family, and concentrated on developing characters instead of stereotypes.  Yes, some people remember the more violent and sensational aspects of this film.  We also know the people in this film.  The Corleone's are as familiar to us as either are own family or neighbors.  Marlon Brando gives an appropriately subdued performance here as Don Vito Corleone.  His character seems melancholic and rueful, seeming to be mourning his situation in life or the changing ways of his chosen way of life, yet accepts the reality and the responsibilities that come for a man in his position.  Al Pacino in his second film, his first being the little seen \"Panic in Needle Park\", is dynamic as Michael, the son that the Don wanted better things for but because of changing circumstance is drawn into the family business.  Michael is to prove that he is more than up to the challenge of settling scores.  James Caan as Sonny, the heir apparent to the Don who may be a little to emotional and hot-headed for the job, does tremendous work here.  Robert Duvall is also good in the role of Tom Hagen, adopted son of the Corleones, who acts as lawyer for the family's business.  It also should be noted that John Cazale appears here as Fredo, the ineffectual Corleone son.  Fredo's character isn't really developed until the second installment of this saga but I would like to note that Cazale, who died young in 1978 but made the most of his short life.  Besides appearing in the first two \"Godfather\" films he also appeared and was quite effective in \"The Conversation\", \"Dog Day Afternoon\", and \"The Deer Hunter\", released after his death.  There are may other great actors (Talia Shire, Richard Castellano, etc.) so numerous who do good work here.  Some would feel that \"The Godfather\" is a romanticized depiction of the Mafia but I don't see that as the case.  \"The Godfather\" is a good story whose milieu is incidentally in the world of organized crime.  On a final note, Coppola contributes an excellent and very informative commentary to the film on the DVD that enhances the viewing of the film particularly for those who've seen it numerous times.",

Then I retrieved Mario Puzo's novel from my book collection and plowed through it, savoring and relishing this extraordinary piece of literature that had such an impact on our cultural landscape thirty-plus years ago.Francis Ford Coppola's THE GODFATHER is a triumphant, magnificent screen portrayal of Puzo's epic book.  The story of an Italian-American mob \"family\" entrenched in inherent and often desperate violence, Coppola weaves this film with compelling, moving, and haunting visuals that are as beautiful as they are disturbing.  The scenes are at once simplistic and complex, yet such a dichotomy is not lost on the viewer, but embraced--appreciated for its overwhelming genius.I've seen more than my fair share of Marlon Brando films, and in my opinion the character of Don Vito Corleone is this actor's signature role.  Brando effectively portrays the Godfather's compassion, love and devotion to his family, and calm acumen to make \"business\" decisions that literally mean life or death to countless men.  Don Vito is both a family man and a killer:  two seemingly inconsistent characteristics that make Brando's portrayal even more remarkable.  The rest of the cast, including James Caan and Robert Duvall, is exceptional, but it is Al Pacino as young Michael Corleone--Don Vito's \"baby boy\" who was not meant to enter the family business--who provides the most telling role in this film.  Before our very eyes, we see Michael change from a man eager to remain at arms-length to the Corleone family ventures to a ruthless, cold-blooded Godfather himself--a transformation both astounding and eery.THE GODFATHER is a feast of unforgettable cinematic moments:  from an ambush at a toll booth to a bloody horse head wrapped in satin sheets.

the few films in which I personally did not find\nany\nsignificant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the\nacting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic\nwritten all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now\nconsidered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it\ncomes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary\nas\nCitizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a\nmovie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for\n\"gangster movies\", but its influence goes well beyond that.The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements\nof\nit can be found in virtually every \"organized crime film\" nowadays; almost\nevery comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed\nsomething in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito\nCorleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's\nimagination.But to say that The Godfather is simply \"influential\" is to diminish its\ntrue qualities, and so is to describe it simply as \"a movie about\ngangsters\". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves\naround\n(despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the\nmovie\nnever tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of\npsychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked.\nConsiderations\non how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear\ndifferent from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a\nhuman\nsoul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a\nstory that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the\nresult\nis a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to\nconsider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic\ntriumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever\nappear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in\nportraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a\nslip.\nThe exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively\nby\nMarlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan\nand Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the\nruthless\nVirgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other\nroles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us\nbelieve these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a\ncentral character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around\nhim:\nalthough Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time,\neverybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it\npossible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to\nobserve how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more\neffectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in\nthe\nlast few years.The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie\n(Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the\nuse of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his\nlife. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's\npower extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely\npopular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless\nkiller,\nDon Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him\nback. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence\nand\nintuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger\npeople\nworking in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete.\nThe Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too\ndangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up\nself-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a\nlong time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close\none\neye. Drugs are another thing.To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while\nmaintaining\nhis economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a\npowerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don\nCorleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by\nthe latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see\nMichael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take\npart in the family business, lose his \"innocence\" and transform into a\ngangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up\nagainst.I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe\nthat\nthe film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and --\nbelieve it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never\nseen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an\nincredible tension, various twists, and although like any other\nmasterpiece\nThe Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still\nbe\na phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for\nthe\nfirst time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such\ncomplicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short\nreview like this one would be inadmissible.There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel\nwritten by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an exposé\nof\ntrue facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for\ninstance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other\ncharacters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that: frankly,\nI\nhave no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra\nreference seems obviously quite believable.The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are\nused perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a\nfair\namount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is\nuniversally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances\nby\nPacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.\n\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb",

A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like\nthis film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This\nwas until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for\nthis sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read)\nevery last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I\ngrew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients\nworking in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across\nthis, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters:\nGood films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat\nbecause the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want\nmono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish\ncontrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes\nfilms deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the\nDon's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas\nSonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply\nhaving these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do\nis to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then\ndwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in.\nThe Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many\ntry to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character\nobscurities that stretch credibility.2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a\ntransformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the\nend of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's\ncharacter must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must\nalso have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the\nwedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film.\nAgain, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal\n(literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall\nStreet).3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple\nreason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was\nnot much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy.

The first time I\nviewed 'The Godfather' I was in my early teens and it was the most\nastounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my\nall-time favourite film. It is due to this that I have been looking\nforward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So let's\nstart from the beginning. The film opens to four words, 'I believe in\nAmerica', it's crazy to think that this simple line has become a\nresonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the\nfilm's \"threshold\". This is just one of the many renowned quotes that\nlitter the film, and believe me, there are a lot. After the first take\nwe are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantly\nportrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando. Vito is a\nfeared man, he is a criminal, he is a mafioso, but above all he is a\nrespected family man, his three sons are depicted by three excellent\nactors, James Caan, John Cazale and Al Pacino as well as his adopted\nchild Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall. The film follows Vito as he\nattempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son, Michael.\nWith some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have ever\nbeen seen in the 1970's film industry (including a certain horse's\nhead), 'The Godfather' epitomises how violence can be used effectively\nwithin a film. The Corleone's are some of the greatest antiheroes to\nhave ever been seen on screen, whilst they are villains, the audience\nwill refuse to accept that fact, Coppola does something simple and\naudacious, he takes the guilt out of organised crime. A film rife with\nbeautiful cinematography, memorable musical scores and well-paced\naction and drama. Overall, The Godfather is one of Hollywood's greatest\ncritical and commercial successes that gets everything right; a\ngangster flick that is overflowing with life, rich with emotion and\nsubtle acting, and further blessed with amazing direction from Francis\nFord Coppola. Arguably the most unforgettable masterpiece to have ever\nbeen made.\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"\n'The Godfather' is the pinnacle of flawless films!", :clean_text=>"the godfather is the pinnacle of flawless films!", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"The first time I\nviewed 'The Godfather' I was in my early teens and it was the most\nastounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my\nall-time favourite film.", :clean_text=>"the first time i viewed the godfather i was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film i had ever seen and has since then stood as my all-time favourite film.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>2, :text=>"It is due to this that I have been looking\nforward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic.", :clean_text=>"it is due to this that i have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>3, :text=>"So let's\nstart from the beginning.", :clean_text=>"so let's start from the beginning.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>4, :text=>"The film opens to four words, 'I believe in\nAmerica', it's crazy to think that this simple line has become a\nresonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the\nfilm's \"threshold\".", :clean_text=>"the film opens to four words i believe in america it's crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the film's threshold\".", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>5, :text=>"This is just one of the many renowned quotes that\nlitter the film, and believe me, there are a lot.

:useful=>"Super Reviewer", :date=>"January 16, 2010", :rating=>5, :percentage=>100.0, :content=>"It's hard to judge a film like 'The Godfather', especially for someone of my generation. Since its release in 1972, The Godfather has accrued a legendary status; it's difficult to watch a film that is often touted as the best of all time with an open mind and no preconceptions. However, after watching The Godfather many times and reading the novel on which it was based upon, it's clearly something very special. The film is a sprawling epic that rewards the viewer with a savagely twisting, multi-faceted plot. It's a mobsters' coming of age tale that's laced with marriage, favours, family, betrayal, tragedy, violence and death.  Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is introduced on the day of his daughter's wedding, a very special day in Sicilian tradition where the father of the bride is to deny no man a special favour. The beneficiaries' utmost respect for the Don is illustrated in the opening stanza, their displays of courtesy coming in the form of personal address and greeting rituals.  The Don is a man of respect and principle, a man who puts emphasis on what's fair, denying to avenge, for example,  a father's anguish over the rape of his daughter by means of murder - 'That is not justice; your daughter's still alive'. In other circles however; the Don is not so respected. Vito Corleone is an old fashioned Don, what is referred to as a 'Moustache Pete'; he is reluctant to delve into the business of drugs, unlike the contemporaries from the rival New York crime families. The Don's refusal turns the relationship between the Corleones and many of the other families sour. It is how the ensuing violence is regarded as just 'business' that is the cold, harsh danger of the film. Its depiction of violence is visceral and often occurs when not expected. Rather quickly, the Corleone criminal empire falls apart; the next generation having to revitalise the family and reclaim their place at the top of the five families.The film is perfectly cast; the primary characters of Vito (Marlon Brando), Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Fredo (John Cazale), Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) and Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) are all expertly interpreted from Mario Puzo's magnum opus. The scores of supporting actors are also without fault; it's a true acting showcase. After reading the novel, it's remarkable how faithfully envisioned the characters are in the film, which is thanks to a combination of physicality and astute interpretation.The Godfather is a brilliant adaptation of Mario Puzo's masterfully told story; the 1969 novel was written with such an authenticity that it almost seems like non-fiction in certain passages. I think it's true that when one thinks of a gangster, they picture the omnipotent Vito Corleone sitting back in his chair, his glum face contemplating with that infinite sagacity and authority. The Godfather is a true spectacle in both mediums; deciding which is best is a difficult task. The only aspect that I felt was stronger in the book was character development. The character of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is given greater depth in the novel; Michael's transcendence seeming comparatively abrupt in the celluloid interpretation. The character of Luca Brasi is abundantly more powerful in the book, whom whilst is an ally of the Corleone family, is penned as an ominous nemesis with a dark, brutal secret. The film, meanwhile, essentially depicts Brasi as an oaf; he is a far less intimidating figure. Additionally, many of the supporting characters are also given interesting back stories by Puzo, notably Captain McCluskey. Of course, that level of intricacy is possible in a novel, while a film could easily become bloated with such detailing. Ultimately, 'The Godfather' is a film made by a highly talented crew who combined the seminal prose of a skilled author with brilliant direction, perfect performances, effective cinematography and the utterly beautiful, distinctive music of Nino Rota and Carlo Savina to produce one of the best, well rounded and moving films ever made. It is a film that is wholly deserving of the term 'required viewing'.", :title=>nil, :location=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"rotten_tomatoes", :url=>"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/godfather/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"It's hard to judge a film like 'The Godfather', especially for someone of my generation.", :clean_text=>"it's hard to judge a film like the godfather especially for someone of my generation.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"Since its release in 1972, The Godfather has accrued a legendary status;

This is topped off by the fact that no reviewer is allowed to like something and then next week not like something there must be a clear pattern. But there is hope. The Godfather. It is a film that cannot be explained in beautiful shakespearian language but just can be said one of the best films in history. This is where the reviewer may take a break and just say with a sense of knowing and fact that everyone agrees on. Everyone has a feeling that this is the best film in the world. And if everyone has the same sure feeling then it must be right. ***** 5 Star", :title=>nil, :location=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"rotten_tomatoes", :url=>"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/godfather/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"To review something seems at first a simple job.", :clean_text=>"to review something seems at first a simple job.", :sentiment=>1, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"You are offered something up, in the form of a dish, a painting or a film, any art form.", :clean_text=>"you are offered something up in the form of a dish a painting or a film any art form.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>2, :text=>"Next you use two skills which most Human beings posses, thinking and writing.", :clean_text=>"next you use two skills which most human beings posses thinking and writing.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>3, :text=>"You then just write about what you think of it.", :clean_text=>"you then just write about what you think of it.", :sentiment=>1, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>4, :text=>"Unfortunately it is not as easy as it seems, not quite paid to eat, it is a hard difficult intellectual process.", :clean_text=>"unfortunately it is not as easy as it seems not quite paid to eat it is a hard difficult intellectual process.", :sentiment=>-2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>5, :text=>"Comparing and analysing every last detail you see before writing another art form.", :clean_text=>"comparing and analysing every last detail you see before writing another art form.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>6, :text=>"This is topped off by the fact that no reviewer is allowed to like something and then next week not like something there must be a clear pattern.", :clean_text=>"this is topped off by the fact that no reviewer is allowed to like something and then next week not like something there must be a clear pattern.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>7, :text=>"But there is hope.", :clean_text=>"but there is hope.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>8, :text=>"The Godfather.", :clean_text=>"the godfather.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>9, :text=>"It is a film that cannot be explained in beautiful shakespearian language but just can be said one of the best films in history.", :clean_text=>"it is a film that cannot be explained in beautiful shakespearian language but just can be said one of the best films in history.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{:dialog=>35, :vision=>10}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>10, :text=>"This is where the reviewer may take a break and just say with a sense of knowing and fact that everyone agrees on.", :clean_text=>"this is where the reviewer may take a break and just say with a sense of knowing and fact that everyone agrees on.", :sentiment=>1, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>11, :text=>"Everyone has a feeling that this is the best film in the world.", :clean_text=>"everyone has a feeling that this is the best film in the world.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>12, :text=>"And if everyone has the same sure feeling then it must be right.", :clean_text=>"and if everyone has the same sure feeling then it must be right.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>13, :text=>"***** 5 Star", :clean_text=>"5 star", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}]}, {:username=>"Zach B", :useful=>"Super Reviewer", :date=>"August 1, 2011", :rating=>5, :percentage=>100.0, :content=>"In cinema, there are few films that can, at all, be considered either great, and fewer that can be considered perfect. Mario Puzoâ(TM)s The Godfather is one of those films that is perfect. Being based of off the best seller by Mario Puzo, director Francis Ford Coppola creates one of the most accurate portrayals of an Italian crime family. When most people think about films that deal with the Mafia, Italian gangsters, what they think about is people that ship drugs, deal with prostitution, and above all else, just fight others for the hell of it. But, what makes The Godfather so different is that, contrary to the rather dark, violent nature of the film, this movie destroys all stereo types as it becomes a film that is not, at all, about running a crime family. This film is REALLY about a father trying to pass his legacy and empire to one of his sons and that one son having to come to terms with his own legacy and the choices he makes. When Mario Puzo decided to originally write the novel that this film is based on, he did it only for the money and nothing else. But what he did not expect was to have his entire creation take a complete life of itâ(TM)s own in a way that only few people can imagine. Even more so was the shock of how well this film did. Want a little taste of how well this film did? Before the film was even released, The Godfather Part II was already in development. But, more on that later. Now, my complete reaction to watching this film. To say that this is one of my personal favorite films of all time would be something of a drastic understatement. With me, there are some films that you like and some that change your life. This is one of those films that changes your life with each and every viewing. When I first sat down and watched this film, I remember feeling complete once the credits started to role. I know that sounds cheap, but it is true. Everything from the story to they way â~Donâ(TM) Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is in this film, it just spoke to me in a way that very few films can ever do. And I am not the only one that felt this way. There is a magic in this movie that can never be paralleled and the closes that we get (and one that is pretty damn close at that) is the sequel that is said to be equal to better then this film. But more on that later. Letâ(TM)s get down to the details. With direction, Coppola does wonders. He keeps the story moving, never dragging behind, and keeps making you interested with the look of the film. While some have complained about the lighting used as being too dark of a film or too gold, I say that the use of that is, quite fantastic. The reason why is because it always sets the mood for the scene and the tone that you will end up feeling. Plus, little added in items like the use of oranges in some scenes give this film a little kick by letting the audience know that something is about to go down. For the direction, Coppola, you do wonders. And the Academy Award for Best Direction was well won and deserved. Now the acting. Oh, my God. What can I say? Well, letâ(TM)s think. Marlon Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor and Al Pacino won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Need I say more? Okay, I will talk about the supporting cast. With huge names like Richard Dreyfus, James Caan, Abe Vigoda, and Diane Keaton, this film is filled with some of the greatest talent that money can buy. But what shocks me the most is that they treat this film with such a tone of seriousness that they literally stop becoming themselves and become these incredible people. Next the score. Like so many classic films, this filmâ(TM)s score is something of a staple in film history. Mostly due to the famous â~The Godfather Waltzâ(TM), Nina Rota became a household name in the music world due to the simplicity of that piece. It was simple, yet set the tone perfectly. The only crime that has ever been done on this film was the score not being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score. Oh well. Later on, this film saga will get itâ(TM)s award. Finally the script. Being adapted from the novel by Mario Puzo, and being written by him and Coppola, this film mirrors the novel so closely that you would only have to read the novel to know more about the extra characters that are not THAT huge. The dialogue is authentic, honest, and bold as this well written script is presented. The Academy Award for Best adapted Screen play was also well deserved. Overall, this entire film is worthy of the magnitude that it has gotten, the awards it has won (including Best Film), and the hearts and souls it has touched.

When Batman Begins came out, I was very sceptical about watching another one of those Batman flicks, such is the enduring traumatic impression Joel Schumacher's films left me. Thank goodness I did and from that point on there's no turning back. Christopher Nolan's finale made all the recently released superhero movies look like child's play to be honest, it is the appetizer to the main course that is the final chapter of The Dark Knight trilogy. The typical critique of Chris Nolan's movies is that it might be too cerebral for the casual moviegoer, no it's not. His films are universal, it's so well-layered, directed towards everyone. If you're more of the \"intellectual genre\" you'll notice the political undertones and social commentaries and what have you, but even if it goes over your head, it doesn't detract your experience from the film. Fanatic fans of the Batman comics will love all the little nods and references, even the major ones from the comic books thoughtfully implemented throughout the film. Christian Bale is just magnificent, as he puts it he plays three characters, the billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne, the true persona of Bruce Wayne still grieving the lost of his parents and the Batman. He's the defining actor of The Dark Knight, his portrayal of all these characters are just perfect and even though he's a man dressing up at night as a bat beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands, we empathise with him. Returning inhabitants of Gotham and Bruce's fundamental foundation of his lifestyle is Gary Oldman's aged and weary morally-strayed Commissioner Jim Gordon, the Q to Batman's James Bond, Lucius Fox and possibly a Best Supporting Actor nominee perhaps, the closest thing to a father figure Bruce can get, his moral compass, oozing with words of wisdom, Michael Caine's Alfred Pennyworth. Scenes between the trio are so poignant, beautifully crafted and presented, it's so hard to watch without getting a lump in your throat, to describe it as tear-jerking ia an understatement. One of the newcomers is Joseph Gordon-Levitt's solid portrayal of beat cop John Blake and Marion Cotillard's enviromentalist Miranda Tate. The chief antagonist is Tom Hardy's full time terrorist Bane, He's frightening to watch, Tom embodies and embraces the sheer brutality and monstrosity of \"the mercenary\" flawlessly with half his face covered up, the way he conveys his emotions with only his eyes is amazing. Anne Hathaway's morally ambiguous Selina Kyle is a wild card, it's really fun to watch the development and chemistry between Bruce/Selina and Batman/the cat burglar. The 2 hours and 44 minutes running time didn't feel long at all, the story flows seamlessly as it comes full circle with flashbacks from Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, it's all beautifully balanced between the intimate moments of character development that's unusual in a summer blockbuster film and the really elaborate and simply put awesome all-out war action sequences and the choreography of the brawls between Batman and Bane is much improved than the previous films. The most important element of The Dark Knight Rises however and what makes it a gem is that it manages to amp up the suspense and anxiety to incredible heights knowing that every single character is dispensable including the Batman. When was the last time you watched a superhero film and feel a genuine concern that our hero is not going to come out alive? Exactly. Thank you Christopher Nolan for not giving in to the public and I'm assuming studio demands to continue this magnificent 7-year journey we have all been through together, to truly end this great vision of the legend with integrity, to give this great story a great and true conclusion to let the Batman ride off into the sunset if you will. It was the ending this iconic character deserved.

It sounds like a stereotypical old man but through a Darth Vader filter. Half of his lines were unintelligible and the rest had any menace robbed from them thanks to the ridiculous tambre. The more we learn about him, the less sense he can his motivations make. Apart from that, the rest of the movie was just... just there. Anne Hathway made a pretty decent Femme Fatale, but the role never really evolved beyond that. I think there were just too many characters and development was spread too thin. I never got emotionally invested in any of the characters, and consequently the action and drama just didn't carry much weight. Speaking of spreading too thin, for a Batman film we see very little of Batman, and only marginally more of Bruce. He spends the entire first act hobbling around and then after two or so action scenes he spend most of the second act wallowing in a cell while what can only be described as 'Stuff' happens. The take home message of the film is shocking. Apart from pissing all over the 'people are essentially good' message of the second film, it also seems to be giving a great big middle finger to the idea of socialism and the Occupy movement. There's also a big thumbs up for authoritarianism. Did Frank Miller write this? Not to mention another subtext which seems to infer you should be grateful if you grow up in poverty or hardship as it will give you strength. All in all it's a deeply flawed film in its conception and execution. It's crime isn't so much that it does things badly (not to say that it doesn't do things badly), but that it doesn't really do anything well. It's the epitome of 'meh', neither good nor bad, but with some shoddy characterization and ideas. A plain cheese sandwich made with slightly stale bread. I think Nolan was too focused on referencing and drawing from comic source material and desperately trying to create a historical parallel, and not paying enough intention to just making a good film off his own talents.

That was the mentality that I had going into the theater, hoping to be pleasantly surprised, yet expecting, at the very least, a satisfying conclusion. I got neither. To put it simply, this was both underwhelming and dumb. The movie opens with an entirely too elaborate plane heist for what amounted to the abduction of some arbitrary nuclear physicist that doesn't become relevant again until halfway in, only to be killed off just as soon as his importance is explained. If you really think about it, he wasn't necessary. All it really amounts to is some pithy moment at the football stadium where Bane establishes that the physicist was the only person capable of decommissioning a bomb, then kills him immediately to shock everyone. That was **** stupid because he wasn't even in Gotham before he was abducted, but I know everyone else in the audience was mesmerized and got chills. Idiots. Speaking of which, Bane's voice was impossible to understand and surprisingly wimpy sounding behind that mask. Maybe it's just me, but I seriously had no clue what he was saying when he talked in the microphone, further distorting his already hard to comprehend voice. Honestly, the movie jumps from plot point to plot point so quickly that you barely get the gist of what is going on before the shot changes again. Something else that was noticeably absent was the grittiness of the first movies. The emotions felt more genuine in the first two movies, whereas the acting in Rises felt phoned in. No one character really gets a whole lot of screen time. You don't get a chance to give a damn about them before the scene ends. Lotta plot holes in this movie, too. First, the movie establishes that Bruce Wayne has no cartilage in his knees any longer for some reason, forcing him to walk around with a cane. That's remedied by a quick scene showing him using high tech joint support devices that solve this problem while also enhancing his strength to the point that he can break through stone without effort, but then as Batman, he gets the case of the stupids and gets his dumb bat ass kicked by Bane, captured and stripped of his Bat Suit as well as joint support gadgetry, and abandoned in some underground prison. Not only that, his back is broken. So, magically, he's cured of his joint problems with absolutely no explanation, and being hung by a rope fixes his broken back. Dumb. Catwoman barely has any screen time, and arbitrarily wears a fetish leather suit with goggles later in the movie. Also she is an implied lesbian/bisexual with the scant couple of scenes and dialogue with her blonde friend or perhaps roommate. It's not really explained or necessary, but does it really matter? You're not doing the math when all you can think about is sex, are you stupid? Robin is a cop who actually doesn't help the situation even one god damn time. Nothing he does actually affects anything, so I have no clue why he's in the movie other than for the one line where someone tells him he should use his full name, \"Robin.\" Wow, was that supposed to shock me? You think I didn't know who he was supposed to be? Oh, and somehow Batman is able to fly a nuclear bomb out to sea with his Bat copter thing with only 40 seconds left on the timer, then escapes from a 6 mile blast radius, when just two scenes before we see him just barely outflying tank missiles inside the city. The movie even confirms he somehow did this by indicating that he flew his copter back to Luscious' weapons depot without being noticed. I found this movie very hard to watch because of how brain-dead it was. This movie obviously wasn't meant for me. It was meant for morons with 3 second attention spans.

The next problem is the action. The whole \"comic book movie\" excuse that gets banded around so often can really only make up for so much. The core of the issue is that in Nolan's Batman universe, bullets seem to be more precious than diamonds. For some reason this did not feel quite as obvious in the previous two installments as it did in this one. Every action scene has mooks running up to Batman or other characters with guns in their hands to be easily disarmed. The frequency with which this happens in staggering. Barely anyone ever fires their guns throughout the movie and when they do, they make Stormtroopers look accurate. This culminates in a massive all out battle in which literally thousands of people suddenly forget the deadly projectile launching devices more or less all of them are holding and start laying into each other with whatever is available on hand. The sheer absurdity of the scene makes it impossible to ignore the issue even if you'd intentionally not payed attention everyone running up to martial arts specialists to be easily disarmed up to that point. All of this casts an absurd, practically silly light on the action that really detracts from the movies tone. Next problem: Exposition, exposition, exposition, exposition, exposition...you can see where I'm going with this. A character enters a plot important room and they start spouting exposition about it to people who quite obviously and unmistakable already have this knowledge beforehand, and nobody questions why they are being told something they already know. The sheer volume of exposition in this movie pushes the already ridiculous runtime past the point of tolerance. Honestly, I feel tired of this movie. I felt tired of it by the time it finally ended on it's awful cop-out ending, I felt tired thinking of all the things that really did not work in it, and I feel tired listing them here.

Nolan has in the past provided massively entertaining well written, scripted and directed works of cinema, (TDK, Inception and YES prestige) I do not doubt his talent. TDKR was not one of them, the dialogue lacked the wit and pithy impact of the previous film to the point where everything felt rushed and miscued. The plot 'twists' were obvious, unnecessary and entirely un-intriguing. The action scenes were fine, a little drab although I appreciate the 'broken Batman' concept. Bane was good and would have appeared better if the rest of the plot had stood well around him. A suitably frightening bad guy I loved the voice and the interactions between him and his army (although why they are so willing to die at his command is never fully explained).

I don't want to knock this film for not being the previous two though, that'd be hard given how staggering the Joker was in the last movie, but as a film in itself it just isn't that spectacular. First the good; some of the characters are excellently portrayed. Bane in particular was fantastic, both built like the proverbial brick privvy but educated sounding and melancholy, although it's hard as hell to hear him at times. Catwoman was also very good and most of the regulars in general, though this in itself seemed to make Bruce Wayne/Batman seem somewhat sidelined. The visual were good and clear with nice scenery and the like, special effects not being too over the top and so forth. The ending (what we've all realistically been yearning for) was a mixed bag and that leads me onto the weaker aspects. The road to the ending was ridiculously convoluted. The plot is jarring and it felt at points that my suspended disbelieve had been hanged from the neck until dead and hung from a skyscapper. Gaping plot holes present themselves as the story weaves and back tracks and slides from here to there with a few unsubtly placed references that will no doubt crop up later in some significant way. Hey! Hey! You see this thing? Notice how we are mentioning it now?! So convoluted is the plot that it makes a review hard because I don't want to give much away for the folks who want to see this movie. Allegiances change and new villians crop up so much I gave up trying to understand their motives and just waited for the finale. The final twist regarding characters almost made me facepalm and mutter to myself 'seriously?'. In short, with out giving it away, Bane is the big villian who wants to use a doomsday weapon on Gotham (you've all seen the trailer with the stadium, don't pretend you haven't). But the way he goes about this evil genius plan is just bizarre and left me questioning who the hell is actually running Gotham? From bizarre police tactics, to a lack of massive fire outbreaks (earthquakes = gas line ruptures) to the outside world just going 'meh' at tense situation, plus a utterly weird mechanic for forcing the plot resolution, the film veers from silly to stupid amidst long stretches of not really very much happening. I was actually a tad bored about an hour in for a few minutes and when the action did resume my brow was knotted with disbelieve. I think in particular to a scene with police versus baddies in a scene not unlike the film Zulu with regards to firepower. What ensues just doesn't make sense but provides a wonderful showdown for the heroes/villains. And while the acting is one of the strongest ponits of the film (with a genuinely touching scene with alfred and bruce wayne) some of it is just hacky and truly 2D. There's even some special cameo's which instead of making me more excited, as they should, actually gave me the impression the film was just trying to hard to fit every significant character in. Appart from the tragically dead ones, of course. And then there was the ending. I can't say a great deal without spoiling this and I wouldn't want to do that, but then that's the point. Put it like this; a film is about the journey, not the ending. If I spoilt the ending the film wouldn't seem that worth it. The sixth sense, by comparison, you might think that the progression of the story was enough that even knowing the ending (he's dead. If you didn't know it by now, shame on you), you still were taken on a journey by the film. The DKR didn't feel like that. At first I was angry (Batman being my favourite superhero), but then I thought, no, it's a brave way to end things that Mr Nolan's done and I respect that, I respect that he's taken this, probably unpopular, path to conculude the story and that he's- on now wait he hasn't after all. Hey!! Remember that thing we kept shoving in your face!!! Surprise! Even the tying up of the loose ends sadly seemed a little forced and unsubtly, leaving an overall bad feeling in my mouth, washed down with now flat cola. Pros: Some excellent actors for roles of Bane, Catwoman, Alfred, Blake and Gordon. Good special effects. Good scenery and cinemtography. An attempt at a unique and unorthodox ending to a superhero trilogy. Cons: Some dodgy acting and bad voice work, especially for mumble mumble Bane. Ridiculously convoluted plot. Gaping and fatal plot holes (five month old sweaty cops anyone?) Not enough balls to go through with the supposed ending to make a unique film. Overal a rather sad 5/10 (would be 6, but I don't want this showing up as a green). P.S.

worst film ever made, The Dark Knight Rises is certainly a major letdown. The film is mired by numerous plot holes, logic errors, jarred storytelling, amateurish editing, bad pacing and transitions, and lack of explanation as to who the new comers are and why we should care. Not to mention the plot twist after plot twist that is thrown at the audience during the dull 2 1/2 hours you'll spend watching the movie. There are numerous things touched on in the beginning that are ultimately thrown to the wayside (see: Bruce's \"brace\") that distracts from the viewing experience and breaks the immersion of the film. There are also problems with the voice acting given during this movie; Bane is the primary culprit, but even Bruce, Alfred, and of all things Batman have issues with clarity and not sounding ridiculous.

There are several twists in The Dark Knight Rises that add a level of complexity that the previous two films did not have. That being said, The Dark Knight Rises is not better than The Dark Knight because of its muddled plot and rushed ending sequences. The muddled plot comes from the fact that Nolan relies to heavily on the ending sequences to explain earlier events. For some that is good enough, but I expect more from Nolan. Also certain events in the film seem over the top and in some cases there is no explanation for how they came to be. Especially, the French Revolution like court scenes. There are many other examples, but I do not want to spoil the movie. Despite these flaws, The Dark Knight Rises manages to keep you engaged because of the wonderful characters and the outstanding perfomances from the actors. The newcomers, Tom Hardy as Bane, Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, Joseph Gordon Levit as John Blake, and Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate are all wonderful additions that add compexity to the film and some wicked twists at the end.

Yes, that means I thought it was even better than The Avengers which, in and of itself was also incredible. Batman Begins is still my favorite superhero movie of all-time but this film matchs The Dark Knight if not surpassing it by a hair. I'm big on plot and character development so that's the only potential negative I can give the first Dark Knight. It felt more like an action based movie and got away a bit from the development of the Bruce Wayne character. Well, this movie returns to furthering the development of the protagonist to a very in-depth level. Of course it also had the amazing plot development, action sequences, and dark realism of the first two that made this trilogy as a whole the best set of films in superhero history. I'm not going to lie, I had some concerns about this movie going in. The first concern was the selection of Tom Hardy and Anne Hathaway as Bane and Selena Kyle/Catwoman, respectively. Well, just like Heath Ledger, these surprising selections turned out to be perfect for how the characters were portrayed. As villains go, Heath Ledger's Joker is still the best villain in cinema history as far as I'm concerned but Tom Hardy's Bane comes incredibly close. The only negative I would say here is that there were a few scattered moments where his dialogue was fairly difficult to understand. I think they could've cleaned that up a bit more. Now Catwoman, WOW! I thought Anne Hathaway did an absolutely amazing job here. I honestly think she was by far the best catwoman yet and I don't think she could've done a better job. Kudos to Christopher Nolan once more for seeing what so many other people couldn't. As I said before, the action sequences were stunning as usual. There's nothing new there. One thing I will say that I loved, as with the first two, is how realistic they manage to keep a lot of the fighting and action scenes. Along with the overall darker tone, the realism has really made this series more enjoyable than ever. The ultimate judge for this movie, though, is how well the plot unravels before your eyes. The first two movies each had pretty intriguing twists and turns that were somewhat unexpected but they don't touch this one in that regard. The discoveries of the Talia al Ghul and Robin characters, Bane's origin and purpose, Catwoman's development (in addition to Batman's as mentioned prior), and all of the tie-ins that round out the trilogy were incredible. Plus, the way the ending unfolds in truly remarkable and writing it here just wouldn't do it justice.

Bane provides a fitting villain, he's for one pretty scary and two a perfect choice for the film, his brute strength and brilliant mind provides Batman with one of his toughest villains. Tom Hardy is also very good in the role, obviously he cannot beat Heath Ledger as The Joker, but Hardy portrays Bane as sinister and an uncaring almost beast. As mentioned unlike the first two films in Nolans trilogy, this time he creates a film that you will enjoy more and more upon multiple villain, for there are so few slow scenes, the whole films is high tension and fast paced, and the budget must of inflated from the first, for if anyone has seen he trailer think that's it, believe me it not. Anne Hathaway is arguably the best Catwoman yet, she is a real femme fatale and is not the sexy Michelle Pfeiffer, but a Catwoman we really care for and can't wait to see, any of her fight scenes are almost better than Batman himself, but she fits so well in this film. She provides a sort of narrative device for the film, and if not for her other scnes would not occur. Her sub plot also fits very well, and we want to see her achieve it, and I'm so glad they put Hathaway in the final film and no other. There is obvious flaws in the film, especially where some scenes feel as if they are treading the same ground as Batman Begins, but this is only because The Dark Knight was so different to the original, but Dark Knight Rises is very different for as I mentioned this is simply an action-war-epic.

:content=>"I saw this film midnight on July 19th as part of the Dark Knight marathon, showing all three films in a row. I can honestly say this made the experience even better because it let me in on the fact that the Dark Knight trilogy is the \"Star Wars\" trilogy of this generation. In my eyes, a trilogy should end with no more questions, everything answered and wrapped up, with only your imagination with \"what happened\" next when it's all said and done, and this trilogy did just that. I only wish that the Hollywood system would produce more stories like this onto the thousands of screens across the world. Time to break down my favorite aspects of the Dark Knight Rises film. First off, the ending. Batman (Christian Bale) latches onto a nuke and starts up The Bat to take it out of Gotham before it blows, but before he does, he gives a small hint to Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) that reveals just who Batman is to Jim, who says to himself in a chilling moment \"Bruce Wayne?\". Then, as Batman has the bomb safely away from the city, it blows up. In such an emotional moment of the film, you can't help by get that feeling in your throat as the Dark Knight sacrifices himself to save the city that was almost doomed. That feeling becomes stronger as Alfred (Michael Caine) stands over the grave of Bruce Wayne, and weaps. Almost in tears with what happens, your heart begins to beat a bit faster when Jim Gorden discovers a new Bat signal, as you get a small bit of confusion, a feeling takes over you...that feeling is Hope. Alfred sits down in a cafe in Italy, the same as the dream he explained earlier in the film, and looks up and smiles, you know exactly what's coming next and you cannot help but smile as it reveals Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle, happy as can be. I had cold chills throughout this ending and I couldn't control the emotion driving through my body. There could not have been a better ending to this film. Film is all about feeling something, and being almost in tears for a sad reason one minute, and then smiling and crying like a small child the next, is an indescribably feeling. It will be a long time until I feel this about a film again. Michael Caine needs to be recognized for this film. Alfred has a larger role in this film that he has in any other of the films, and it's incredible to watch. Alfred has always been the one and only person that can stand up to Bruce/Batman and get away with it. He's the voice of reason throughout the series, and the caring father figure that Bruce needed. In this film, Alfred reaches a new low in his life, having a heavy fear that Bruce will become Batman again, and end up in a grave, leaving Alfred completely alone and taking away the last person he cares about. Caine was the stand out emotional performance in this film, and when Alfred leaves Bruce in the middle of the film, an emptiness is felt until you see the familiar face again. It's been reported that Christian Bale told Christopher Nolan that he would be Batman, as long as Robin wasn't in the films. I agreed with this because it would have taken away from the main story of Bruce Wayne/Batman in the films. Or so I thought. John Blake (Joseph Gorden-Levitt) is a Gotham cop, who knows the identity of Batman and gives Bruce Wayne the push to come back. He also helps in the fight against Bane's army to save Gotham. In short, the John Blake character was a very rewarding character. But the most interesting and awesome information about John Blake is revealed in the last moments of the film, when it's revealed his legal name is Robin John Blake. I didn't think a Robin could be done right in a \"real\" and \"gritty\" film series like the Dark Knight trilogy, but I was wrong. Alright, so I'm running out of characters in this review so this is going to be a speed round of what else I liked about the film. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle was great. Many people thought she was a poor choice for the character, but it's done so well and she brought it to life. Bane is also such a physical force on screen. What Tom Hardy is able to do with limited facial expressions is phenomenal, especially when tears fall from his eyes when it's revealed he was a protector of Talia Al Ghul. The cameo appearance of Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow was subtle but perfect. It was such a nice little touch to a film that wrapped up the full story of Batman Begins. My hat if off to you Mr. Nolan. You were able to bring the art of story telling to a new height in a system that seems to forget about it way too often. I'm excited to see what is next in the Nolan film world.

U gonna luv it, i tell u coz the first time it feels like listening to 5 hours long lecture of ur teacher at college covering upto 3 long chapters. As u watch it the 2nd time or the 3rd, u will be very familiar with the small characters n ur mind wont be diverted frm the emotions n action spectacles n most importantly the central story coz u will know how they r gonna wind up dead or disappear frm the movie. yeah too much muchness has cost this movie many negative reviews even frm diehard Nolan fans but i tell u when u watch it 2nd time, everything u dislike about this movie calling it boring will be substantially reduced. IT is the movie whre Nolan isnt only interested in character of Bruce/ Batman but also on other characters of Gotham like kids, prisoners, oppertunists, rich fortuners, dutiful cops, terrrorists, newcomers in Gotham n many many more. All these characters build up Gotham city i.e 12 million other people xcept Bruce Wayne. Nolan's intention of picturizing all the lives of people residing in Gotham City in this huge canvass of epic movie comes with a little bit price like overlong, boring n maybe even bloated coz the uninteresting portions will occupy ur mind n may even sideline the interesting portions like actions or raw emotions coz u know the better parts are there in the movie but you cant remember where. But if u watch it 2nd time u already know there r this unteresting portions or characters n hence u can focus more on the interesting ones. This movie is epic, grandest n most spectacular movie of this summer but it is also something that tests your focus, attention and patience. If u succeed in your test, the outcome is the most rewarding one you have ever received with the grand climax n the perfect ending. Even Bane made me emotional. I dont think he is wasted at all. Before his death, he surely has his moments. Marion Cotillard is even great too. Anne Hathaway is stunning as Selina Kyle. Though a cat burgler she has her emotional side. U can see her sad facial expression and even tears during some moments in her eyes. The best performance goes to Michael Caine. Though his role is short, he gives u the necessary emotion to carryout in the movie. Christian Bale is better than the last, looked to me on par with that of Batman begins as Bruce Wayne. Joseph Gordon Levitt is pretty good. He is the most optimistic character of the movie. Action scenes r stunning especially the football stadium one. The ending is brilliant though i dont think even now Batman really lives. I think Chris hasnt made it clear he lives or not. The ending doesnt give clear answer. Its just the indication that Christopher Nolan n Christian Bale will be no more in Batman franchise. If u dont love this movie, then dont go to theatre to see movie again. IT just ask u for ur little patience(maybe more), focus n attention and as i said the reward will be truimph victory for you. A piece of advice- i found staying at the front seat as possible than at the back more enjoyable in the theatre as it enriched my viewing experience n i also had more focus/ attention and hence it didnt felt boring at all the 2nd time i watched it like the 1st time. I also have heard from some of my freinds that if u watch it more, the more u will love it. Its like a feast that u cant eat n digest at once.

This was pretty damn good but it definitely had its problems. Bane's voice was almost impossible to make out most of the time. The addition of Catwoman was okay but nothing really extraordinary.

The biggest problem though is the first act.It really drags and they could have lost about 10 or 15 minutes to tighten up the pace. Once the second act kicks in though, that's when the whole story becomes really engaging. It's awesome how Bane unintentionally 'recreates' Batman without knowing it.

This one really represents the bookending of the entire series. In the first chapter Batman does NOT exist until he escapes from the League of Shadows and the same is true when he escapes from the prison in this one. The great irony of both these movies is that the antagonist in each case actually creates Batman, the only person that can stop them. This is why the first fight with Bane is dismal. It is not because of a lack of physical conditioning, it is because this is not Batman fighting Bane but Bane fighting Bruce Wayne doing the best he can.

The peaceful Gotham City where police officers feel they will soon be \"chasing overdue library books\" is rocked by a series of events orchestrated by the ferocious and calculating villain, Bane.The pace of this film is slightly slower (and heavier) compared to the previous two films, partly because there are a lot more characters in this film, and Nolan being the master storyteller that he is, gives each character enough time in the film. It could seem a bit lengthy at 3 hours of thereabout because of this. Lucius Fox and Alfred return in their usual roles of being Batman's brains and soul respectively. Michael Caine's performance as Alfred is simply remarkable even though his screen time is somewhat limited in the film. Christian Bale, as usual, has done a great job portraying the battles within Bruce Wayne - overcoming his hears and rising from being as good as dead to come back to save his beloved city. His character comes a full circle from the first film as Thomas Wayne's words \"why do we fall down Bruce\" echo through this film and Bruce seemingly understands their meaning here as he prepares to pick himself up and \"rise\".New characters added a refreshing touch to the series. Anne Hathaway is brilliant in her role as Selina Kyle. She lightens up the serious macho overdose of the film with her flair and flamboyant ways. Bane, with links to the League of Shadows, brings a dark element unlike any Gotham has witnessed before. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays John (Robin) Blake perhaps a younger version of Jim Gordon. He seems to be set to take over the reins from Commissioner Gordon, but eventually chooses to stay free of the shackles imposed by structure and protocols by the GCPD. Marion Cotillard (I thought she was brilliant in Inception) plays a convincing partner and love interest of Bruce Wayne.The conclusion is definitely a lot heavier in terms of content and pace compared to the previous two films. This film requires focused attention to the dialogue and sequence of events, previous 2 films seem somewhat lighter compared to this one. The fact that Bane's voice was muffled with his mask doesn't help in this regard, it only increases the level of focus one needs to have which watching the film. In addition, the film has more characters with their place in the film. Chris Nolan has spent a fair amount of time with each character to fully bring out their roles and let the audiences savor the nuances of their personalities, inner conflicts, and goals. I personally think the editing room could have shaved off a good 15 to 20 minutes from the film, but this is Nolan's signature style of storytelling. Also some scenes make Batman seem too human, like the street fight scene with Bane towards the end. Batman is a superhero and it feels somewhat strange to see him battle his enemy bare hands in the middle of a street-fight. That being said, there are plenty of new toys in his arsenal and the Bat, in particular, is awesome!Yes, the performance of Heath Ledger and the compelling storytelling of The Dark Knight are hard to match, but TDKR is an appropriate and epic conclusion to what I think is one of the best series of super-hero films made to date.", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[187, 252], :date=>" 2012

In steps Bane: a super-strong, methodical terrorist leader intent on destroying Gotham and ends up forcing Batman/Bruce Wayne out of retirement. There's a lot of elements at work in this dynamic story (taking obvious influences from the Batman comics Knightfall, No Man's Land and Dark Knight Returns) and the movie's almost 3-hour length is felt, but Nolan's strong directing and script manage to bring it all together and he keeps things moving at a brisk pace.As much as I like the story in 'The Dark Knight Rises' it's the characters I found myself most vested in. Regular greats Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman return as Jim Gordan and Lucius Fox, while Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays honest cop John Blake and Anne Hathaway the thief Selina Kyle (each giving the film both an every-person to follow and moments of comic-relief). Marion Cotillard gives protagonist Bruce Wayne a business partner as well as a love-interest in Miranda Tate.

It's fun seeing Batman  drive through the dark in the Bat-Pod, stealthily take down criminals from ceilings and dodge gun-fire between muzzle-flashes. Watching a middle-aged and physically impaired Bruce Wayne build himself back up (especially after a nasty beat-down from Bane) is almost as awesome as watching him become Batman for the first time! Christian Bale's amazing performance sells this character in every scene and I especially liked how his relationship with his Butler Alfred played out (an equally compelling Michael Caine with much more screen time). This is the hero I wanted in the first two films!While the direction is sharp and the story exciting, 'The Dark Knight Rises' does have some obvious faults. Hans Zimmer's musical-score is strong as ever but the film's sound kept drowning-out character's dialogue, even during some key moments; Bane's voice-box really didn't help matters either.

(Christian Bale) in a rather depressed state of mind.  He has essentially withdrawn from the world, given up his crime-fighting ways and hung up his Batman cape, having largely fallen out of favor with the citizens of Gotham City who see him less as a hero and more as an out-of-control killer.  Only his loyal servant/father-figure, Albert (the venerable Michael Caine), cares enough to give him a swift kick in the rear-end every now and again to try to get him to move on with his life.  All this changes, however, when the fascistic Bane comes to town, a figure so consummate in his villainy that he is willing to blow up the whole blasted metropolis with an atomic bomb if he doesn't get what he wants.Though Christopher Nolan`s latest entry in the series is nowhere near as engaging or as gripping as the previous two (especially the second), the movie attains a certain historical and contemporary significance with its echoes of both the French Revolution and Occupy Wall Street, though, oddly, the movie seems intent on putting us on the wrong side of history in both cases (rooting for a corrupt status quo and against a grass-roots uprising against that corruption).And, let's face it, Heath Ledger's Joker - one of the richest villains in all of movie history - would be a hard act for anyone to follow, and Tom Hardy`s Bane, even with his mask and amplified voice, seems a mite tame in comparison.  On his own terms, however, Bane is reasonably effective, if only because of the implacable nature of his evil, which manifests itself in his willingness to sacrifice masses of innocent people to enrich his own power.Thanks partly to the muddled politics and partly to the overstuffed nature of the storytelling, the movie never finds a way to fully engage its audience in the world it's created. In fact, in comparison to the narrative sturdiness of its two predecessors, \"The Dark Knight Rises\" comes across as a bit of a messy affair overall, with subplots spinning off in all directions, with little gravity at the core to bind it all together.

Truly, I did.  With the production values and people behind it, everything on paper said this movie should be an absolute joy.  And I suppose if you ignore the previous films, and franchise as a whole, turn your mind off, and just watch these pretty scenes cut together then it can be enjoyed just fine.  Delve any deeper, however, and you might find a story that does not mesh with the series, the franchise, or reality, and one that becomes heavy-handed in its drama.  Warning, this review does contain spoilers.The Dark Knight Rises takes place eight years after The Dark Knight, and Batman hasn't shown his face since the climactic events of that movie.  Wait, what?  The previous movie establishes a continued need for Batman, of how this is supposed to be a hero that can accomplish things a normal man cannot, yet directly after establishing that and the credits roll we are expected to believe Bruce Wayne hung up his cowl and sat in his room mourning for eight years...when the death of someone close to him is what set him off to begin with.  The idea of a Batman just giving up is...unfathomable.  Yet that is the basis this film hinges uponSo we get into 45 minutes of slogging through this plotline, of Bruce Wayne being a crippled hermit slowly brought out of retirement by a thief linked to a greater plot.  45 minutes before we see anything of the Batman.  We get things like the Harvey Dent Act, in which criminals are able to be held indefinitely without parole.  We get a character knowing the connection between Bruce and Batman...all due to the pain he recognized in Bruce's eyes over the loss of his parents.  We get Alfred telling us in exacting detail the ending of the movie two hours before the ending of the movie.  We get the great dossier of Bane, of how he escaped from a hellish pit to be trained by Ra's al Ghul, a person whose entire organization was a massive secret yet somehow now has a former members listing.  Then there's a great stock exchange robbery, where clearly illegal transfers are somehow allowed to stand, followed by one of the poorest moments of editing I've ever seen, where a daytime chase scene switches very suddenly to night as finally, dun dun dun! the Batman makes his anticipated appearance......and fails to do anything impressive.  Remember in Batman Begins, the sequence of taking out Falcone's men one by one?  Or crashing in on the Scarecrow?  Remember in The Dark Knight how he managed to smuggle a money launderer our of Hong Kong?  Or managed to subdue an entire SWAT team before they mistakenly killed a bunch of hostages while taking out numerous armed criminals?  Or flipping the semi truck?  There's none of that here.  Batman's grand entrance consists of a bunch of people getting all excited watching a guy ride a motorcycle.  Oh sure he punches a guy or two and o hai!  Flying Bat vehicle.  But none of this accomplishes anything.  These things are just there to be there without any of the jaw-dropping set pieces.  But wait, Batman's not done yet!  He also...punches a bunch of guys.  Lots and lots of guys, in an open space, who don't realize they have guns, or how to attack more than one at a time.  Exciting.  And how about that fantastic fight midway through the film against Bane, where Batman turns into a full out brawler who suddenly forgot about all the equipment he's shown off the past two films.And this is supposed to be the better half of the film.From there the plot is finally unveiled to us and everyone goes full retard.  See, the League of Shadows wants to get revenge on Bruce Wayne for his destruction of their base and killing of Ra's, as well as to fulfill Ra's legacy to cripple Gotham.  To do so they do things such as seduce and comfort Bruce during his time of need and take months to set off an explosive which could wipe out Gotham instead of blowing the thing and being done with it.  To stop this nefarious plot the police send their entire force into a sewer system where they suspect Bane is hidden, with predictable results.  Then, to complete his embarrassment of the police, Bane reads a letter from Commissioner Gordon detailing the truth about Harvey Dent and Gordon's lie about Batman's supposed murder of him...and people just believe Bane.  But do the trapped police forces die?  Nah, of course not.  Over the following months Bane's forces keep them well-fed, despite all intention to just blow the city up.  Do I really need to explain the problems with all this?  So the film takes a turn and focuses on good cop Blake and his stay in a broken city, trying to restore order without any success to speak of.  His story is a long wait for no payoff.  Meanwhile, we spend another 45 minutes of film without any Batman where he must slowly build himself to recover and don the cowl.  Again.  For the second time in this film alone.Then when Batman makes his (second) triumphant return?  He appears back in the city.  Which is locked down under threat of extreme violence.  From the other side of the world.  When he has no money or equipment.  With no explanation.  There's big, epic fights, (obvious) plot twists (Talia al Ghul?! no wai) and a great, climactic battle in which weaponless cops (apparently all lost in the sewers)take on vastly superior numbers of criminals armed with automatic weapons in a gigantic...fist brawl?  In which Bane's plot is resolved out of nowhere.  In which the true villain dies in terribly acted fashion moments after being formally introduced. And in which Batman can escape a nuclear blast in five seconds and Gotham has never heard the words \"nuclear fallout\" used together.But it's ok.  In the end it all works out.  Bruce runs away with Catwoman, having given up the cowl for good (ironically when the city might need Batman most, considering the state of chaos it happens to be in and all the escaped criminals which happen to be free, not to mention repealed Harvey Dent Act releasing all mobsters back into the world and thus negating everything he accomplished in the first two films) and nobody recognizes the famous billionaire playboy who drunkenly burned down his home, lost all his money and mysteriously died at the same time as Batman.  Meanwhile good cop Blake (real name: Robin) takes on the cowl...without any of the training.  After having not accomplished a single thing of note during the entirety of this nearly three hour epic film.When everything's said and done, this does not feel like a part of anything.  It uses familiar names and faces, but they don't line up with anything we've ever known, they don't act in any logical manner, the film follows no rules of the series or reality, and it follows none of the established themes.  It's as if the writer never read the comics or understood the happenings of the previous film.  Remember that chilling moment when Joker said, \"I think you and I are destined to do this forever,\" and you just had to wonder when he might escape and who the next villain might be to show their face?  There was an understanding there about the characters and franchise which went completely unrecognized in this story and the movie collapses in on itself because of it.", :rating=>2.0,

I knew it wasn't a bad film, but at the same time it just didn't sit right with me for whatever reason. So I went back and watched Begins and TDK and I think I figured out why I didn't really care for it. In my opinion it doesn't seem to fit with the other two films.Warning: Some spoilersFirst there's the setting. The concept of a broken and retired Batman living as a recluse is interesting, but it seems to sort of contradict what we saw in the other films. We learn that he hasn't been Batman for 8 years since Dent was killed, which made me wonder, why is he in such bad physical shape then? Rewatching The Dark Knight, I didn't see anything to show where these injuries came from. Why is his leg screwed up? The last scene of Dark Knight was him running away from the camera. If he hasn't been Batman since then and has been living like a hermit, how did he screw up his leg? Also, why did he stop being Batman? Rises seems to suggest it was stress over Rachel, although that happened midway through The Dark Knight and didn't seem to stop him. He sort of suggested at the end of Dark Knight that since Dent died, he had to be the hero. That was sort of the point of Dark Knight that Gotham's savior had to be either Dent or Batman and since Dent died, it had to be Batman, but then Rises suggests that Batman just kinda went home literally right after that. Rises sort of gets around this by introducing what I consider to be a highly implausible \"Dent Act\" in honor of Harvey Dent, in which all of Gotham's criminals are apparently just straight locked up with no sort of legal due process, the streets become clean as a whistle, and Batman \"isn't needed anymore\". The Dent Act also asks you to believe that everyone now believes without a question that Batman killed Harvey Dent, despite having saved him very publicly from the Joker in Dark Knight. I find it strange that things like this are considered realistic, yet more cat features on catwoman's suit are not. Anyways..Second, the villains. I found Bane to be just plain underwhelming. Physically intimidating sure, but I felt like they had to seriously water down Batman's competence in order to artificially make Bane more threatening. In Begins and Dark Knight Batman would fight using his surroundings. That's basically how he fights, something he learned from the League of Shadows and Ras Al Ghul. \"Always mind your surroundings.\" Yet when confronted with Bane and reminded of the League, Batman simply charges at him swinging like a brawler. No tech, no using the environment around him, just straight fisticuffs. I realize that he's been \"retired\" for 8 years, but again, that felt forced and unexplained as I mentioned in my first point, which just reinforces my belief that this was done simply to make Bane seem more threatening. As for Talia, she just felt too much like Ras, and a lesser version at that. Not only does she not get the character development that Ras got to make him interesting, but in the end she's only doing it to carry out Ras' will, which just made her feel like a pawn. The main villian and she doesn't even have her own plan. Overall they felt too similar to the Begins villians. In Begins the villains worked within the system, using it to try to destroy Gotham. In Dark Knight the villains worked to try to destroy the system and induce chaos in Gotham. In Rises, I was expecting another progression to give the villains an overall theme to work with, but it just feels the same as Begins. Talia manipulating the system to try and destroy Gotham.Third, not enough Batman. Having Bruce trapped in a pit for the better part of the film's second half served no purpose imo. I don't think anybody thought that he wasn't going to escape this pit and return to face Bane. I realize this sort of had to happen based on what we know of Bane and Batman in the comics, but the way it was handled only served to take us away from Gotham and Bane where things were getting interesting, and into a dull situation miles away in which we already know the only possible outcome. Obviously the movie won't end with \"And then Batman died in the pit\" It employs odd and often confusing time jumps that the previous films didn't have, taking away from the pacing and making the film feel frantic. Once Bane starts implementing his plan and things start to pick up, there's literally a 5 month time skip that glosses over Gotham transitioning from normal society to anarchist warzone in favor of Bruce's previously mentioned antics in the pit.Warning: Spoilers!!!!!!Fourth, John Blake. I liked the character and portrayal but I felt the \"big reveal\" about him at the end was totally unnecessary and handled in the worst possible way. First off... his actual legal name is Robin? ....... I'll leave that at that, but what bothered me more about how this was handled is that again, this doesn't seem to be consistent with the previous films. In Rises we get Bruce spouting a bunch of nonsense about how Batman was supposed to inspire people into action and that \"anybody can be Batman\" Oh really? What about those guys in The Dark Knight who were trying to help Batman take down Scarecrow and some drug dealers? They tried to be Batman and Bruce responded by kicking the living cr@p out of them, breaking all their weapons and then making fun of their outfits. They did exactly what he's talking about in Rises and he personally beat them up for it. Just seems weird is all..  Also, how did Blake know Bruce was Batman? You can assume that since he's a cop he could've done the detective work and figured this out, but he doesn't say that's what happened. He says he literally figured it out by having met Bruce once a long time ago and recognizing he had the same hidden pain that Blake had from losing his parents? Really?! That's it?! How can you reasonably make such a huge assumption based on meeting someone once and looking at their face?Fifth, Catwoman. Again, nothing wrong with the performance, but I felt her character was unneeded. Nothing she did in the film seemed to matter, except of course for the fact that they decided to let her be the one to kill Bane. The romance between them felt forced as well imo. I don't see why he would be attracted to her. Her ideology is almost the direct opposite of his. In the comics there's a sense that she genuinely cares about him and a lot of that is due to their long history, none of which we get to see here. I never really get the sense that she saw him as anything other than a 1 percenter or necessarily cared about his well being. When Bane \"breaks\" him, she doesn't seem concerned about him, just concerned about what Bane will do to the city and how it will effect her. It's all about her and I just don't really see what draws him to her in this film.Finally, the ending. I get it, he retired. Batman gets to live a happy life in Europe or whatever with Catwoman. Great for him I guess, but isn't Gotham gonna be worse than ever now? Gordon will likely lose his job as commissioner because of his 8 year lie to the public and for knowingly framing Batman for Dent's murder. Dent has been revealed as a murderer, meaning the Dent Act will likely be repealed and all these criminals are gonna come pouring back to the streets, including Joker, who isn't dead and who happens to be the direct cause of almost everything that happens in Rises to begin with. I get that they can't use Ledger anymore, but I for one found it strange that they deliberately chose not to once mention the Joker even though nothing in Rises would be as it is without him.And who's left behind in Gotham to handle this new mess? \"Robin\" John Blake, a man who now has Bruce's suit and gadgets, sure, but none of the League of Shadows training that would let you take on dozens of thugs/SWAT officers at a time, meaning the first time he suits up and hops down into a group of 5 guys thinking he's a bad@ss, he's gonna get wailed on. Bruce didn't even bother to train the guy like the real Robin. Not only that, but Bruce only met this guy what... twice, for a total of 10 minutes and he trusts him with the Batsuit? But I guess Bruce isn't concerned with any of that anyways. He's \"moved on\" and I should be happy that he doesn't have to be the hero and protector Gotham needs like we've come to expect from him over the course of this trilogy, right? I just feel like it sent a strange message where you should do what you feel is right but only until you're tired of it, then you should sit back and have some \"me-time\" with a foxy lady despite the fact that there's still more to be done. I dunno about you but that just struck me as not very admirable and as something no respectable version of Batman would EVER do...Overall the film is well acted and looks and sounds great, but it's only mildly entertaining and drags in a lot of places. I also felt it was the least realistic of the trilogy which I found unfortunate since the realism is what drew me to the trilogy in the first place. Things like the Dent Act, an old man in a pit who can heal a broken back by punching it, a usb drive that can erase your name from every computer on the planet and a cheesy imo nuclear bomb plot that emerges somewhat randomly near the end of the film serve to make it the most comic-booky feeling film of the three. All that said, again it's not a bad movie by any means and I'd say it's worth a watch, but it's easily the weakest of the trilogy in my opinion.", :rating=>3.0, :percentage=>60.0, :useful=>[537, 762],

fan of superhero movies, I didn't have much\nexpectations for Batman Begins. However viewing the 2005 Christopher\nNolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge\nexpectations for, \"The Dark Knight\", Christopher Nolan blew my\nexpectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last\nfilm, \"The Dark Knight Rises\"? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations\nwere once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true\ncinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in\nterms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals,\ndirection and action are all top notch. The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Christian Bale, of\ncourse still makes is a great Batman. Michael Cain is fantastic, as he\nalways is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be\nconsidered for an Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy as Bane is utterly\nterrifying, at times, and completely ominous. Anne Hathaway as\nCatwoman/Selina Kyle is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing.\nEveryone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors are so well\ndone, so well written, and so well directed. The Dark Knight Rises is\nis emotionally riveting and amazing to view.At a running time of almost 3 hours, the film never becomes dull, which\nis pretty impressive. The movie's action sequences are spectacularly\nwell created and very intense. The dialogue between the character's are\nintelligent and highly believable. The movie's soundtrack is terrific\nand really exemplify's many of the movie's scenes. Extremely well\nediting and sound use really develop many of the movie's action scenes,\nso it's not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies.\nNolan creates a grand, dirty, engrossing world, and his action\nsequences just hum. In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and\ndirection can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero\nmovies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. I am\nwholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who\nworked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of\nits very famous literary source. I cannot recommend this film anymore\nthan I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it.\n10/10\"\n*** This review may contain spoilers ****** This review may contain spoilers ******

has outdone himself with this one. At 3.30 in the\nmorning, I was tired. Just getting out of it, I've never been so awake. Perhaps what set this film apart from his other films was that it had a\ngenuine emotional heartbeat. I felt that this was a flaw of Nolan's\nother films - the vision of emotion was there, but it was hollow. In\nthis I bought it. I felt it, hero and villain alike.Christian Bale was typically brilliant as Batman, and I felt that Bruce\nWayne was more heavily embraced in this final installment. Bale added\nemotional depth to the character - a plot point that I think went\nastray in The Dark Knight - picking up from the development made in\nBatman Begins.Tom Hardy as Bane was quite simply, terrifying. No longer a dunderhead\n\"enforcer\", but one of the criminal masterminds behind \"Gotham's\nReckoning\", coupled with a physical dominance strong enough to send\nshivers down your spine.Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle defied my expectations. Hands up who was\nnot entirely convinced that that girl from the Princess Diaries could\nhandle an intensely physical role like Catwoman. But here I am, hugely\nimpressed. She added immeasurably to the value of the film.Marion Cotillard fulfilled the role of Miranda Tate admirably, though I\nsuspect this was the most underdeveloped character of the film - though\nafter watching, I can see why.The unsung hero of The Dark Knight Rises is Michael Caine as Alfred. A\nheartfelt performance that helps drive the emotional content of the\nfilm, helping Nolan sell his most well-rounded film to date. Caine's\nperformance in both presence and absence.Special mention goes to Joseph Gordon Levitt, who is consistently\nproving himself to be a big player in the Hollywood game. His role as\nofficer Blake felt like there could've been more, but it may just have\ncome all a bit much. It was a great performance, and Levitt sunk his\nteeth into role. If you can, go see this in IMAX. If any film was to sell the format to\nskeptics, The Dark Knight Rises would be IT. I'm happy Nolan stuck to\nhis guns and shot in 2D. 3D would have been unnecessary. I suppose at this point, I have to turn my focus on Nolan. If he ever\nreads this... aspiring filmmaker to filmmaker, I've never been so\nenvious, jealous in all my life. It's a film that leaves me\nfloundering, wondering what I could possibly do to get anywhere near\nthis ballpark. Well done. I think an Oscar Nomination is in order.From here, I'm not sure what to expect of the future. Does our\nimagination carry us forward, or do the studios?

But, he still\ndoes his character justice and performs to his full potential. For the\nfirst time in the trilogy, Batman wasn't the strongest. This gave a\nchance to Christian Bale to show off his acting skills without the mask\nand he did a fine job. The veterans Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and\nMichael Caine went about their job as if it was just another day at the\noffice.

:content=>"\nThe best thing about this movie is how satisfying it is. It doesn't\nleave you frustrated or confused. You can't really complain that it\ndidn't explore certain ideas or follow through. By deciding to have an\nofficial ending to this trilogy's story, the themes surrounding Batman\nare very fresh. We don't know where he'll end up. It's not the same old\nthing about whether he can continue to be Batman or not, which was\nalready getting repetitive in Spider-man 2. The conclusions are not as\nimportant as the feelings they invoke as they come about. Nolan is\nespecially good at capturing the complete tension of actually not\nknowing what will happen and deeply questioning what you *want* to\nhappen and why.This movie is bigger than the previous two, far more ambitious. There\nare no obvious annoying weaknesses that usually come with films in\ngeneral, especially blockbuster action movies. All of Nolan's movies\nhave deep psychological themes and this takes those in another new\ndirection. I thought Inception was hugely original and insightful about\nthe way people think. That level of abstraction and depth is present in\nthis film. Bane bursts into it, his reputation is quickly established.\nNolan uses people's expectations and anticipation to the fullest. We\nare left to wonder about what has happened in the 8 years since the\nevents of The Dark Knight. Why have the characters become the way they\nare now?In the latter half, it does seem like the movie is trying to pull off\nso many different plot points and connections, but they all work. The\ncast is very large and impressive. You don't see \"good acting\". You see\nfascinating characters. They're just playing their part in the grand\nstory that's being crafted. There are many unfamiliar faces but they\nall have a strange, unique look to them. We often see a person's flaws\nand previous decisions coming back to haunt them. They find out the\nhard way what mistakes they have made. Where their limits are. Where\nthey lose control.The score is almost tribal, very raw and energetic. You don't get much\nchance to pay attention to it but many parts of the movie are pounding\nwith excitement. There are countless quotable lines and disturbing\nslices of dialogue. They cut deep. The Joker was a great character and\nthis is a very different movie but the themes are just as dark, only\nperhaps indirectly. Underneath, it's very sinister. Writing and\nefficiency appear to be among Nolan's greatest strengths. The story has\nmany layers that interweave and apparently they came in under budget.Perhaps the most important thing about Catwoman is that she's\ncompletely believable. When she beats up men, you don't roll your eyes.\nShe's feminine and powerful in her own way. She fits into the world and\nwe completely understand her motivations. She doesn't have a huge role\nbut a very important one.I didn't find myself moved but maybe I'm too cynical. I was more\naffected psychologically. Curious about humanity and all the different\nsides of it you see in this movie. It goes to many extremes. I felt\nhumbled by my complete lack of life experience. What do I know about\nanything? How could I possibly understand half of the characters? I\nhaven't been through anything or achieved anything compared to most of\nthem. Michael Caine gets a bigger role this time. He was always\ncritical but this time he's very much the emotional core.I thought Christian Bale was overlooked in The Dark Knight especially.\nThe movies hinge on him. Bruce Wayne's just a man but also incredibly\ninspirational. Bale's famous for completely committing to his roles and\nit pays off. Tom Hardy is impressive as Bane but I suppose that's no\nsurprise. The rest of the leads are similarly awesome. There are many\nreferences to the earlier films. Very few questions are left\nunanswered. It's always nice when film-makers really think it through\nand make an actual decision and get all the details right.So anyway, I'll miss Batman (since the trilogy has ended) but couldn't\nhave hoped for a better, more epic and sincere finale to his story.\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1345836"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"\nThe best thing about this

:username=>"ammerender-singh", :location=>"from India", :date=>"20 July 2012", :content=>"\nI came out with slight disappointment after watching DKR for I had huge\nexpectations from Nolan after an exceptional TDK.I am huge fan of first two installment of Batman Trilogy and I liked\nDKR. It's a good movie but it could have been much better. So rather than discussing its merit, which are many, I am pointing out\nits shortcomings.It's the weaker than other movies of trilogy and simple reason being it\nlacks strong characters. DKR is all about storytelling \u0096 just like\nNolan's Inception but not as efficient. And in doing so it fails where\nBatman Begins and The Dark Knight had succeeded.Batman Begins was all about fear, doubt, self-realization and\nredemption where Bruce Wayne discovers his destiny as Batman. BB had a\nstory arc which set background for main characters \u0096 Batman/ Wayne,\nRa's al Ghul, Gordon (to some extent) and most importantly Gothom City\nand hence set stage for a fitting climax.The Dark Knight explores the theme of chaos, morality and belief\neffortlessly and establishes characters of Joker, Harvey Dent/Two Face,\nRachel etc. so effortlessly that people choose to ignore even some\nmajor plot holes. Heath Ledger's interpretation of Joker was so\nmesmerizing that it single handily carried TDK to path of greatness/\ncritical acclaim.But Dark Knight Rises is all about story telling \u0096 efficient but not\nexceptional. Bane, Miranda Tate, John Blake, Peter Folly (Deputy\nCommissioner), Selina Kyle \u0096 characters are introduced but never\nexplored/ expanded - they just start working on their part - just like\ncogs in the wheel. They are not so much part of the story itself but\njust the agents which move the story forward.Bane's character is dull and single dimensional and do not evoke any\nfear or awe. He's meticulous, intelligent and strong and this is\nestablished quickly in movie but after that he slumps into a just\nanother movie villain. Taila / Miranda character is never fully\nexplored. Even Wayne/Batman is devoid of any emotions in this one and\nhe feels so sure of himself that I start wondering if it's the same\nBatman that I saw in first two installments. Only new character which\nhad some shades was that of Selina Kyle and Anne Hathaway did justice\nto it. Add to that helplessness of Alfred portrayed superbly by Caine.\nOther actors are good but there's not much for them to do.There's no dilemma,doubt, love, choices, moral battles, hope, even no\nchaos/fear- things which make characters and plot interesting ( at\nleast for me) and which made Batman Begins and The Dark Knight really\ngood movies. Even the theme of \"Occupy Wallstreet\" is very weak and at\nbest it's closer to London riots with its loot and arsoning. There's\neven perfect order in Bane's revolution. Movie moves effortlessly from\none plot to another and to climax that it become at times predictable.But maybe Dark Knight Rises was supposed to be like that only and Nolan\nhad too much to deal with in 2.5 hours. And maybe that's the main\nproblem with DKR \u0096 too much is going on in the story that it seems\ncrammed at times. And when there are too many characters and so many\nstory arcs and it's tough to do justice to characters and story telling\nat the same time. And this is when you start looking for plot holes,\nslackness, predictability et al.-----------------some spoilers----------------------- Such as Bane's plan \u0096cement/explosive, Wayne- Miranda's romance, Blake\nguessing Wayne's personality, Miranda-Talia twist, Batman doing Angels\n& Demons stunt,Batman's escape from death, Blake as Robin (LOL) and\nAlfred in last scene.------------------spoilers end -------------------------All movies have a style which depends on story and its story teller.\nAnd there' no point of comparing different styles, say that of\nStarwars, Godfather, Transformers or story tellers say Tarantino,\nCameron etc. Whatever maybe the style, good movies play to its\nstrengths \u0096 story/screenplay, characters, style, pace or all. Try to\nrecall some good movies and think what you like the most.Dark Knight Rises have a good story but lacks strong characters and\nrelies Inception's style which incidentally differs from style of first\ntwo installments of Batman Trilogy. And for me, soul of Nolan's Batman Series is its strong characters,\ntheir underlying emotions and a theme which is much deeper and\nmeaningful than all fight, gadgetry and style. And this is where DKR\nfails. 7/10\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1345836"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"\nI came out with slight disappointment after

years after the death of Harvey Dent, a reclusive Bruce Wayne brings Batman out of retirement to combat a ruthless mercenary with an army of fanatical followers who hold the entire city of Gotham for ransom. I feel I have to begin this review by pointing out that The Dark Knight Rises is a beautifully crafted superhero blockbuster, because otherwise it's going to sound extremely negative! The problem for me is that this film is somewhat lacking in the \"X Factor\" that made the first two instalments seem so very special. Let's face it, Tom Hardy had an act that's basically impossible to follow but when the script touched on the moral ambiguity of the character of Bruce Wayne (that he's essentially a billionaire who goes around beating up poor people to maintain the establishment's status quo) I thought that Nolan had done it again. Unfortunately he chose not to explore the social implications, instead electing to hang a bomb over the heads of this \"citizen's revolution\" reducing Bane to another hostage taking thug instead of a radical revolutionary. I also think that removing Alfred and therefore much of the humanity and humour from the equation was a mistake and I would have liked a little more ambiguity (a la Inception) as to the fate of the character. Plus I could also point out that the story is basically Rocky III crossed with Star Wars with yet another generic race against time tacked onto the end. All of these complaints conspired to make me somewhat disappointed with the film, but I reiterate; this is only by the incredibly high standards that were set by the franchise.

I think there are two camps for the Batman films and like marmite you either like or dislike them. Lets step into the Nolan universe one last time then shall we...supposedly.So the film continues on from the previous two films and continuity wise its very well done. Everything and everyone is back in the places they should be ready to follow through on this epic portrayal of the Batman. Problems arise as we delve deeper into the story and the main villain 'Bane' begins to cause problems for our hero.Of course being a comicbook adaptation you can't expect the film to be totally serious or sensible, there will always be elements of fantasy. The problem with this franchise is its made out to be a serious thriller type, the well used 'Heat with Batman' phrase springs to mind. Thusly the comicbook element has been somewhat drained away, yes it has, you can't really have it both ways folks and this third installment stalls trying to incorporate both sides. Make your mind up Nolan.I'm gonna be harsh as such a ridiculously high level was expected with this film there seems no other way to bring it down to earth. Plot holes? yes, the plot isn't anything particularly original and its skips around like crazy. 'Bane' breaks Batman's back, OK, yet he then drags him to a prison somewhere in the middle of nowhere and leaves him to recover, what? why not just kill the guy and then you've won you silly villain. While I'm here, where was this prison exactly? a desert? the Middle East?? huh?.Upon this we then have the rather daft notion that 'Wayne' then recovers from this horrendous injury merely by doing lots of push ups, sit ups and chin ups...oh after he was strung up with rope for god knows how long, eh?.Once 'Wayne' is back to full fitness he manages to escape the inescapable prison naturally, but then hold on, one minute he's in the outback somewhere, next scene he's back in Gotham?. On top of that how did he get back into Gotham seeing as its locked down and cut off?.Carrying on with 'Bane' his voice, I'm sorry but it just sounded hilariously stupid to me, like something from an old Peter Cushing 'Hammer Horror'. I realise it wasn't suppose to be overly intimidating or forced like Bale's god awful Batman voice but come on! it was like some kind of chirpy English sort from 'My Fair Lady' haha. Add to that the curious design for his face mask which still kinda looks like a dog muzzle made in a school metalwork class.As for the other anti hero character in 'Catwoman' I'm split. I still hold firm on the bad casting choice for this character as Hathaway looks far too weak and princess-like to be able to hold her own. The outfit was a hot potato and although in motion it didn't look too bad the entire idea that she is a top catburglar yet runs around basically showing off her whole head and face is so stupid. Surely this concept meant that 'Catwoman' required her much loved hood for cover? you'd think it would be a good move for identity secrecy. In dialog Hathaway performed well with her devious slinky ass but in action she simply didn't look right, as suspected.To be quite frank the whole film was quite average really. The effects weren't anything to shout about like the ropey CGI football field explosion, the jerky rubbery Batbike thing and oddly shaped Batwing thing. Also the film did seem somewhat watered down this time also. I know death has not been shown in full glory in any of the films but even more so here, complete cut aways in some places, very childish for a hard edged approach.We all knew from the outset that Batman was gonna get his arse kicked, what we didn't know was how it might all end. To be brutally honest the whole thing was very lackluster and seemed to even pinch a plot idea from the original 1966 caper with Adam West!. I am referring to the finale where Batman must make a decision to save Gotham City from the mighty bomb. Gee errr just fly away with it Batman?.This film has shown how good the previous two films are for me, and I'm not the biggest fan of the second. It just seems as though this film ran out of steam, baddie character choices and eye popping set pieces. 'Banes' death was way way too weak for such a big presence, the 'Scarecrow' cameo felt unnecessary or crowbarred in for no reason, the 'Blake' character was always the obvious new 'Boy Wonder/Batman' type right from the get go and pretty much everything tied up very predictably right down to the fact that 'Wayne' appears to have survived after all, bless.If you enjoyed the previous films then I'm sure you will carry on enjoying this final adventure, if not then you won't think much of this. It does come down to whether you prefer the fantasy aspect of Batman which is gloriously shown in the Burton films if somewhat over done at times, or you prefer the grounded, hard serious approach by the Nolan trilogy.Visually dynamic (accept for the awful camo coloured tumblers), bold, flashy and with a great stellar cast but ultimately overrated and it still just doesn't feel like a Batman film.

It`s an amazing and breathtaking epic thrill-ride. It stands as one of the great trilogies in movie history and sends Batman off on a satisfying farewell and does not disappoint. Every great story needs a great ending, and this is that ending. A true instant classic. An unforgettable masterpiece. One of the greatest movies of all time. Director, Christopher Nolan has crafted one of his finest films, and one of the best films in years to hit the screen. It surpasses Batman Begins and The Dark Knight in every way imaginable. A brilliant work of art that comes full circle in a monumental film. It`s dark, grim, gritty and furiously entertaining. A bold, stylish and pulse-pounding action-packed adventure that will blow you away. The action is incredible, some of the best action scenes i have ever seen, especially between Batman and Bane, which are some of the best crafted fight scenes ever. The drama and the characters are wonderfully done and dig bone-deep with their development. The suspense is mind-blowing, with one or two twist you will not see coming. The all-star cast are all truly astonishing. Christian Bale is spectacular, he brings back the darkness and emotional torture of both Batman and Bruce Wayne, and dosent miss a note with his performance. Tom Hardy is brilliant, he is an unstoppable force of nature, he does alot even with his eyes and does not fail with this explosive performance. Michael Caine is outstanding, he shows he is truly the heart and soul of the piece. Anne Hathaway is wonderful. Joseph Gordan Levitt is terrific. Gary Oldman is fantastic.

It looked cool at the time, but my teenage brain couldn't handle anything past the loud voices and constant cussing, but kudos for style points. The second time I saw it (maybe another 12 years after the first) I believe it was supposed to be a DVD rip, but the sound encoding was atrocious, so I only enjoyed it in part. The the third time I saw it (about 3 months ago) was off of Netflix streaming with decent enough audio, but not so great video. Ironically enough, the one time I finally get to see and hear the darn thing with quality A/V is on Blu-ray. That being said, it should go without question by user vote on IMDb, critic appraisal, or any number of awards and accolades given to this film that Pulp Fiction has cemented itself as a true game-changer in the halls of cinema legend. Be it the achronological storytelling, the sassy script, the dark humor, the quirky characters, or just the amazing level of star power involved from every which way, there's a lot to like about this film. For me, personally, it's the method. I don't mean the cut-up timeline (which is enjoyable in itself and keeps you on your toes), but how so much of the dialogue is \"just there\" from a purely jovial or character-developing perspective. Talks of Amsterdam and their legalization of drugs, the differences between European and American culture, the frivolous comparison between a foot massage and going down on a girl, the significantly comedic monologue of a P.O.W. storing his best friend's watch up his anus for years only to deliver it to his son, and all kinds of other seemingly random stuff \"capped off\" by a stride at redemption would make you think otherwise about this being nominated for seven Oscars, right? Well, as most people often say about Quentin Tarantino films, \"you should just see it for yourself to know what I mean.\" And the result after almost 20 years? It's a part of our modern day pop culture with all kinds of quotable lines, a beacon of entertainment and inspiration within the industry,and, for all intents and purposes, one really fun movie to watch. Is it for everyone? Of course not. But most would say it is.Video - 5.0- Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC- Video resolution: 1080p- Aspect ratio: 2.35:1- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1The front and back of the slipcover and the back of the cover art says that this transfer was supervised by Quentin Tarantino himself and even has a copy of his signature on the slip, so what you see here was what the director intended. And I have to say, after 3 very poor video outings (VHS, a crappy DVD rip, and Netflix streaming), I have to say I've never seen the movie look this good (literally). The production budget was only $8 million, which by today's standards would still only be about $12 million. But wow, am I glad Tarantino used some quality film stock. First and foremost, I have to commend the black levels. All the tiny little details, linings, reflections, and textures look absolutely pristine on this presentation. Particularly, the wetness of Jules' Jheri curl, as laughable as the look is intended to be, adds a nice aesthetic sense of throwback to the Blaxploitation genre that Mr. Jackson's character is portraying. And then you have the hallmark scene where Vincent is taking Mia to Jack Rabbit Slim's, which is FULL of dark lighting, and yet still manages to display an amazing amount of detail around the restaurant itself, its patrons, on Thurman's hair, and in Travolta's suit in addition to the smoke he's blowing. Colors, while somewhat muted from an art direction standpoint, are surprisingly bold. The scene where Butch is taking money from Marsellus in the bar is full of red light, but in comparison to other brightly red-lit backdrops (which isn't many), I'm pleased at how a lot of the detail still remained intact. Then, of course, is the blood. Maybe it was more so the stuff they used to be the blood, but when it splatters, it looks great. Not real per se, but it's one of those artistic subtleties that Tarantino does well in his films. I am also happy to report that there is very little, if any, hints of dirt or artifacting. There's a fine layer of grain (and I mean very fine), but it doesn't seem like any DNR was added. Edge Enhancement? Not too sure, I'm typing this review with only 4 hours of sleep and might've seen a tiny little bit, but it's hard to say when I'm not all there. Regardless, though, I can tell you everything else looks superb, especially for its age.Audio - 5.0Languages- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1Subtitles- English, English SDH, SpanishAnother big part of Tarantino's films outside of its aesthetic and literary homages is the sound, particularly the music. As soon as Surf Rider starts playing it's easy to tell that this DTS-HD MA 5.1 track will do its job and do it well. LFEs are at their most prominent when any of this great soundtrack starts playing. Even as the radio switches to Jungle Boogie in the opening sequence, there's not a discrepancy to be heard. But how do the rest of the sound elements hold up on this seemingly quaint sound design? I mean, how can 230 pages of script possibly earn a 5 point rating? Oddly enough, this film's sound scape has a LOT of immersion. Shortly after the credits have done their thing we get a great audio treat in the first scene where Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are contemplating their change in venue for an upcoming robbery. I actually wouldn't even know this if I hadn't accessed all the extras, but the trivia track says that even in this very first scene, despite the achoronlogical plot structure, if you listen hard enough during Pumpkin and Honey Bunny's conversation you can distinctly hear Jules talking to Vincent in the background from a scene to be shown later on in the film. How cool is that? And while the weak point of the sound effects may be in the meager gunshots, the sheer sense of engulfment that every other crowded scene has to offer is sonic gold. Directionality and separation sound wonderful during these parts putting you right there in the thick of things. Meanwhile, high and low ends still manage to be very well-calibrated, specifically in the scene where Mia is getting her adrenaline shot between all the paper raffling around and the eventual thump on her chest. Oh yeah, and the dialogue couldn't be any clearer. From Jules' intimidating preacher vibrato to Fabienne's sweet and sexy accented-English, the movie has never looked OR sounded better. My favorite scenes to test the audio would be the aforementioned robbery attempt at the beginning of the film and the always-exalting trademark scene of Vincent and Mia going to Jack Rabbit Slim's (when they walk to their table and when they start dancing).Extras - 5.0Wow, I should really have taken a nap before work instead of trying to rush this review out for everyone to get a fresh take on the product, but I'm glad I at least got to learn a lot of things despite my soon-to-be headache at the crap hole at which I work. At any rate, this BD is loaded with extras. Most of them are DVD ports, but I'd never seen this on DVD anyway, and thus, am just seeing all of this for the very first time.- Not the Usual Mindless Boring Getting to Know You Chit Chat (HD; 43:01)A new HD retrospective with most of the film's actors discussing how they were cast, how the shooting went, and all of the things that ensued after the film came out. There's a lot of information here about the movie itself, its writing, and how a lot of the actors felt working with Tarantino.- Here are Some Facts on the Fiction (HD; 20:37)Another newly-produced featurette that shows a roundtable discussion with critics and their thoughts on how Pulp Fiction has affected the industry, their favorite parts, and some of the things that make the movie so good.- Pulp Fiction: The Facts - Documentary (SD; 30:31)Is from the Special Edition DVD (as is everything else from here on out) and is something of a mishmash of the pre-production, filming, and reception of the movie up to 2001.- Deleted Scenes (SD; 24:30)Feature commentary for 4 out of the 5 scenes by Tarantino and are enjoyable, if you want to at least take a one-time look.- Siskel & Ebert At the Movies: The Tarantino Generation (SD; 16:00)Is a short look at the quick rise of Tarantino's status and whether or not they think he was legit at the time. It comes off rather pretentious, though, so I wouldn't recommend it.- Charlie Rose Show (SD; 55:27)Features a GREAT interview with Tarantino and discusses a lot of his film-making roots, his philosophy as a movie-lover, and what he believes makes a good film.- Independent Spirit Awards (SD; 11:29)- Cannes Film Festival - Palme D'Or Acceptance Speech (SD; 5:20)- Marketing Gallery (SD; 16:13)Lots and lots of trailers/teasers.- Still Gallery- Enhanced Trivia TrackA trivia track that pops up all sorts of tidbits of information in the subtitles telling you all the quirks about the film itself, if any of you like that sort of thing (and some of it being very funny).Overall - 5.0As fervid as my review sounds, I'm actually not that big a fan of Tarantino. Aside from seeing this and Inglorious Basterds more than two times each, I've only seen his other films once. I didn't really get into Reservoir Dogs and the Kill Bills were stylish enough, but keep in mind it's been nearly five years since I've seen those, and five years is a lot of time for my brain to better develop. But to the point, yes, Pulp Fiction is definitely one of those films that somehow managed to turn a bunch of dialogue into a fun and raucous movie. It's well-written, especially well-acted, and is a good way to spend two and a half-hours. With top-notch A/V quality and over 3 hours of specials, an SRP of $19.99 is practically nothing for such an renowned title that finally made its way to a proper BD release.", :rating=>5.0,

Quentin Tarantino is a very gifted director/writer.  Although I love his directing, I must say it is his writing that really impresses me.  But I will get to that later on in this review.I think it's safe to say that the first time this movie was released on DVD, it was a little more than disappointing.  There were no special features, sound and picture was so-so; I mean, my laserdisk at least had three different trailers of the movie.  So, of course, I was very excited to learn that this movie was being re-released in a fully loaded special edition.  Re-buying the movie was well worth it, for this edition of the movie is far superior than the other one.The movie really consists of three different stories; not in any order.  Any one of the stories could be their own little movies.  The players are two hitmen, a boxer, the big boss, the big boss' wife, a crazy gun store owner, a gimp, a cop named, Zed, a man who makes problems go away, and a little suitcase with \"666\" for the combination.  You add all this together and you get one hell of a movie.The acting is more than superb; including one terrific cast with some heavy hitters (Travolta, Jackson, Thurman, Willis, etc.).  Tarantino is a master when it comes to writing and directing.  Especially when it comes to writing.  I have never heard such clever and brutally honest dialogue in any other movie.  I have said it before, and I will say it again; Tarantino reminds me of Raymond Carver, except with more humor.Now, on to the special edition of this DVD.  Is it better than the previous version?  YES!  Tons of special features, and not to forget the fact that the movie has been restored in high definition.  Picture looks very clear.  And the sound is also a lot better.  You can watch the movie in DTS, which is always a good thing.Special features.....where do I begin?  There's a ton of them!  It's not even funny how much stuff is loaded on this bad boy.  And every one of them is great.  Features include a documentary, an interview with Tarantino on \"The Charlie Rose Show,\" trailers, filmographies, and many more.  If you love special features, then you will not be disappointed.\"Pulp Fiction\" is a great movie, and the new DVD edition is outstanding in every way.  If you still have the older DVD of this movie, get this one now!  If you haven't seen it yet, check it out when you can!  Of course, with any other movie, there is a chance you may not like this movie.  That's fine, nothing wrong with that.  Don't let hype ruin your preception of the movie, just watch it as if it were any other movie.  You like it, great; if not, well, at least you gave it a shot.  Filled with sharp humor, great characters, outstanding dialogue, and some of the craziest surprises and twists, \"Pulp Fiction\" is a wonderful film, and will continue to be one of my favorites.", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[259, 307], :date=>" 2002 September 14", :title=>"\"Oh", :location=>"(Orland Park, IL USA)", :username=>"Michael Crane", :source=>{:vendor=>"amazon", :url=>"http://www.amazon.com/Pulp-Fiction-John-Travolta/product-reviews/1558908242"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"Words cannot express how much I love this movie, but I will try my best.", :clean_text=>"words cannot express how much i love this movie but i will try my best.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"\"Pulp Fiction\" is one of my favorites.", :clean_text=>"\"pulp fiction is one of my favorites.", :sentiment=>-1, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>2, :text=>"Quentin Tarantino is a very gifted director/writer.", :clean_text=>"quentin tarantino is a very gifted director/writer.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>["Quentin Tarantino"], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>3, :text=>"Although I love his directing, I must say it is his writing that really impresses me.", :clean_text=>"although i love his directing i must say it is his writing that really impresses me.", :sentiment=>1, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>["Quentin Tarantino"], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>4, :text=>"But I will get to that later on in this review.I think it's safe to say that the first time this movie was released on DVD, it was a little more than disappointing.", :clean_text=>"but i will get to that later on in this review.i think it's safe to say that the first time this movie was released on dvd it was a little more than disappointing.", :sentiment=>-2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>2.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>5, :text=>"There were no special features, sound and picture was so-so;

It was an independent release and its success opened the door up for all kinds of maverick filmmakers and companies to release films that otherwise would have never been made. It also had a profound stylistic influence. It was a hip movie with sharp dialogue, graphic violence, cool soundtrack and intricate plotlines. In the wake of its success, many movies try to copy this style, but most failed as they lacked Quentin Tarantino's unique vision. Mr. Tarantino was able to pull John Travolta out of a decade long funk and directed him to the finest performance of his career and one that garnered his second Academy Award nomination. He also pushed Bruce Willis to a stellar performance that showed he was more than just an action hero. The cast is first rate including a beguiling Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Eric Stolz, Rosanna Arquette and Christopher Walken. The best performance of all is given by Samuel L. Jackson who is absolutely amazing. It was a crime that he did not win the Academy Award for the role. Pulp Fiction is broken up into three parts and includes flashbacks, flash-forwards and twists and turns and some mysteries that are never revealed. It is a rare film that is both stylish and full of substance.  The new Collector's Edition is a huge step up from the original edition which offered virtually no extras.  The sound and visuals are crisper and cleaner and the extra features are great.

I own the DVD, but can't understand the shortage of extras. The laserdisc format has plenty of extras. For example it has the tralior and T.V. spots. Behind the scenes,  the Making of Pulp, the Charlie Rose interview with QT, and four deleted  scenes hosted by QT. Why couldn't we get those with the DVD format.  Hopefully in the near future, a re-release of the DVD will include these  goodies and maybe perhaps a Tarantino-Bender commentary track and a  director's cut of the complete film. The current DVD provides average  picture and sound. It is the best movie ever made and gets better each time  you watch it. You will also find out new things every time you view it. For  instance, the gun on Butch's counter didn't belong to Vincent, it belonged  to Wallace. Remember, Jules had already quit. Butch doesn't have any  intention in throwing the fight until Vincent picks a fight with him. It's  true, go back and watch how Butch acts while talking with Wallace and then  how mad he gets when Vincent starts with him.  Plus Fabeine is pregnant in  the movie, listen very closely to what she says. The movie also has a comic  side to it. I think it's funny how Vincent basically caused everything in  the movie. Just think, Vincent caused Mia's overdose by purchasing heroine  from Lance, in the first chapter. In the second chapter, \"The Gold  Watch,\" Vincent picks a fight with Butch. Then Butch throws the boxing  match. Then in \"The Bonnie Situation,\" Vincent tells Jules,  \"Do you feel like having breakfast?\" Then they go to the diner,  and you know what happens. Vincent is the films main character, and without  him there wouldn't have been a movie because he started all the problems.  Ask yourself these questions while viewing this. Why DON'T Vincent and  Jules die in the apartment? Why DO Vincent and Marvin die after  \"Devine Intervention?\" Why does Jules let Ringo LIVE? Why does  Butch go back to SAVE Wallace's life? What is in the BRIEFCASE? Tarantino  wasn't lazy when writing and directing this film. The more you watch it,  the more likely you'll have the answers to these questions and more. You  need to watch it more than two times to understand it. If you didn't like  it the first time, give it another try. This movie is NOT bad, overrated,  boring or too long like some people say. The actors are great and perfect  for thier roles. Any real movie fan will agree with me. People ask me what  the movie is about and its difficult to say. It's about a lot of things  like honor, pride, luck, faith and redemption.This is my favorite and the  greatest movie ever made!", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[51, 65], :date=>" 2000 February 9", :title=>"Pulp fans demand a better DVD", :location=>"(chicago)", :username=>"dvitoc", :source=>{:vendor=>"amazon", :url=>"http://www.amazon.com/Pulp-Fiction-John-Travolta/product-reviews/1558908242"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"This is of course the best film ever made.", :clean_text=>"this is of course the best film ever made.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"I own the DVD, but can't understand the shortage of extras.", :clean_text=>"i own the dvd but can't understand the shortage of extras.", :sentiment=>1, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>2, :text=>"The laserdisc format has plenty of extras.", :clean_text=>"the laserdisc format has plenty of extras.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>3, :text=>"For example it has the tralior and T.V. spots.", :clean_text=>"for example it has the tralior and t.v spots.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>4, :text=>"Behind the scenes,  the Making of Pulp, the Charlie Rose interview with QT, and four deleted  scenes hosted by QT.", :clean_text=>"behind the scenes the making of pulp the charlie rose interview with qt and four deleted scenes hosted by qt.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>2.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>5, :text=>"Why couldn't we get those with the DVD format.", :clean_text=>"why couldn't we get those with the dvd format.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>6, :text=>"Hopefully in the near future, a re-release of the DVD will include these  goodies and maybe perhaps a Tarantino-Bender commentary track and a  director's cut of the complete film.", :clean_text=>"hopefully in the near future a re-release of the dvd will include these goodies and maybe perhaps a tarantino-bender commentary track and a director's cut of the complete film.", :sentiment=>1, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>2.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>7, :text=>"The current DVD provides average  picture and sound.", :clean_text=>"the current dvd provides average picture and sound.", :sentiment=>1, :context_tags=>{:sound=>100}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>8, :text=>"It is the best movie ever made and gets better each time  you watch it.", :clean_text=>"it is the best movie ever made and gets better each time you watch it.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>9, :text=>"You will also find out new things every time you view it.", :clean_text=>"you will also find out new things every time you view it.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>10, :text=>"For  instance, the gun on Butch's counter didn't belong to Vincent, it belonged  to Wallace.", :clean_text=>"for instance the gun on butch's counter didn't belong to vincent it belonged to wallace.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>["Bruce Willis"], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>11, :text=>"Remember, Jules had already quit.", :clean_text=>"remember jules had already quit.", :sentiment=>-1, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>["Samuel L.

Pulp Fiction not only attracts our attention, it demands it. Much credit must be given to director Quentin Tarantino who co-authored the Academy Award winning best original screenplay with Roger Avary. The influences on his development as a filmmaker are too  numerous to list here but it is worth noting that Orson Welles, Daffy Duck, Akiro Kurosawa, Dashiell Hammett, Spike Lee, and Francois Truffaut would be on it. Many believe that this film saved John Travolta's career. His portrayal of the dangerous but somewhat dimwitted hit man, Vincent Vega,  is brilliant. In fact,  Tarantino assembled an outstanding cast and somehow coordinated the various plots in which they are involved. Destinies intersect, sometimes causing violent collisions. The film's accelerated pace, however, does not preclude \"eye of the hurricane\" moments as when Vincent dances with Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) in a nightclub or when Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) and Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) are held against their will by a psychopath. Tarantino has a very traditional view of film making: He wants vivid PICTURES and he wants them to MOVE. He also cherishes effective use of language, almost to the point that some scenes seem \"talky.\" My guess (only a guess) is that because Tarantino seems to be a compulsive conversationalist, he and members of his cast and crew never stopped talking about Pulp Fiction from the beginning to the end of its production and that many of them are still discussing it nine years after it was first released.This is a nasty, sometimes violent, occasionally hilarious, but never dull film. To those seeing it for the first time who almost immediately become uncomfortable, my advice is to be patient and allow the narrative to continue. You may end up being repulsed. Fair enough. But you may also find yourself enjoying what is deliberately and pre-eminently an unorthodox examination of how MOVING PICTURES can tell a story with compelling impact. For me, the vivid images and my emotional reactions to them dominate the literate, at times loopy dialogue.

Their dialogue\nis witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes\nthese two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you\nmight assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to\nwork. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which\nthey use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk\nhas no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that\nmatter. Yet without such scenes, \"Pulp Fiction\" wouldn't be \"Pulp\nFiction.\" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever\nstruck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent\nbut wonderfully textured.It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the\nsuitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably\nintended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many\nastonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first\nviewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But\nthere is no deeper explanation. \"Pulp Fiction,\" is, as the title\nindicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a\nbrilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other\nfilms, it is like a great work of abstract art, or \"art about art.\" It\nhas all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine\nwriting, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the\nmost well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what\nend? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything\nbut itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's\nessentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the\nthree main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form\nthe subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes\nwrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation\nto come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to\nabsurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to\nfocus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they\nmove the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions.\nIndeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character\never says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could\nhave simply told Yolanda, \"Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,\"\nwhich is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill\naction flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is\nlike. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a\npotential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with\nclever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they\nare full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of\nMia's statement to Vincent, \"That's when you know you've found somebody\nspecial: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and\ncomfortably enjoy the silence.\"What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a\nlot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who\nlooms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The\nwhole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite\nsection of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men\nwithout even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in\nways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced\nwith an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme\nalso helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film,\nits liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used\nas an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point\napplies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with\nrace. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance\nover weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in\npractice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a\nlevel of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding\ncitizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a\npatter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that\nVincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty.\nLater, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're\nnever sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral\nchoice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws\ncan act other than for self-preservation.Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these\neccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really \"about\"\nanything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about\nburgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it\ncontains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't\nneed to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a\nbetter job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind.\n*** This review may

In hindsight, however, it seems to\nme that while the movie must have definitely bowled them over, overall\nthey weren't sure exactly what to make of it or how to articulate what\nwere probably a confused mix of feelings. But I am so impressed that I\nfeel compelled to add a few specific observations to the many fine\nreviews already on this database.First, this movie hits you with an impact somewhere in between, say,\nAPOCALYPSE NOW and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and for some people may be just\nas disturbing (however, in this respect I am happy to report I didn't\nthink it rose to the level of NATURAL BORN KILLERS). Full of\ngraphically violent action and language, PULP FICTION is not a picture\nfor everyone - I would definitely not recommend it to my parents, born\nin the 1930's (even to my one fairly \"hip\" relative of the same\ngeneration who, at age 66, still teaches high school sex education and\nlikes to talk about things like sunbathing nude, among other\npotentially sensitive issues).Irrespective of audience sensibilities, however, the film-makers,\nsupported by superb acting in every role, manage to create a world full\nof the most fascinating sleazy characters possibly ever to appear on\nscreen. From Travolta's pronounced almost-child-like curiosity about\nthe world to Jackson's sincere and thoughtful philosophical ruminating\nand Willis's deep devotion to the memory of his father, I think such\nfascination lies not only in the characters' personalities as they are\nportrayed but in the way they tantalize the viewer into considering the\npossibility that such people could actually exist. As a lawyer of some\nyears' experience dealing with all sorts of people I was particularly\ndrawn to this aspect of the film.Thus, and in response to some other reviewers' comments, I think this\nmovie is more character-driven than plot-driven. Instead of a story\npeopled by basically weakly developed characters employed primarily as\na mere device to move the plot along, as is too frequently the case in\nthe movies (especially these days), the undeniably strong, clever, and\nunpredictable plot lines in PULP FICTION are actually of essentially\nsecondary interest and importance, serving primarily as vehicles to get\nyou worried about the fate of characters you can't help caring about\ndespite the truly low attributes that otherwise form the basis for\ntheir respective personas. As at least one other reviewer noted, when\nthe film ends you are actually disappointed, left craving more of these\ncrazy people and their explosive lives.Finally, and as strange as it may sound, this film reminds me of\nanother Monumentally Great Film which one would never typically\nassociate with it in any way in a million years - CASABLANCA. As in\nthat film made way back in 1942, and as another reviewer has suggested,\nperhaps its special appeal - its unusually high degree of emotional\nimpact - lies in its distinctly successful simultaneous application of\nseveral different genres in a single film - drama, action, dark humor -\nwith the whole thing bound together by essentially flawless execution\nin every department.

Then, by\npopulating the cast with an intriguing hand-picked array of actors to\ndeliver those well-written snappy lines.

It is only after watching the entirety of the\nmovie, and reflecting back on it, does the gestalt emerge for the\nviewer. And, it may take more than one viewing to get there. Then,\nlastly, by topping it all off with a snazzy soundtrack. That's how. Add\nall that stuff together and you get Pulp Fiction.The film received its share of acclaim, and deservedly so. But that\nsaid, while seen by most as a good film, Pulp Fiction is not regarded\nas another Citizen Kane, and Pulp Fiction is not ensconced in the\npantheon of the greatest of the great Hollywood films of all time.\nThose are for a reason. As good a cinematic achievement as Pulp Fiction\nis, the fact is that as a film it plows turf that's just way too coarse\nfor comfort.

And it's all presented in\na very graphic way. Some people really like it that way. Hey, I\nunderstand. That's what Tarantino wanted too, right? But the simple\nfact is that such fare isn't for everyone. Period. In this way its own\nintentional and unrelenting coarse nature is what self-selects it out\nof the greatness category.

And Pulp\nFiction of course certainly wasn't his last film. The Kill Bills, Vol.\nI and Vol. II, 2003 and 2004 respectively, were noteworthy and\nambitious projects. And Jackie Brown (1997) made its mark too. But\nlet's be honest here. When it comes to Tarantino it looks more and more\nlike Pulp Fiction is as good as it gets. And he hasn't moved much\nbeyond dwelling on the coarseness in any appreciable way. In fact, he's\nstill earnestly tilling that soil. And getting less and less out of it\ntoo, if Grindhouse (2007) is any measure (and most will say it is a\nmeasure). Of course at his age he has the potential of many more films\nin him screaming to get out, but unless he evolves in some new\ndirections, unless he stretches himself in some new and different ways\nas a storyteller, Pulp Fiction may end up being his magnum opus.

:content=>"\"Just because you are a character doesn't mean that you have character\"By the time that Quentin Tarantino's sophomore effort  reached us in 1994, he had already been heralded as the new wunderkind of American cinema. His debut Reservoir Dogs recaptured the magic of the heist thriller and his screenplay to the bold and brilliant True Romance opened up a real desire to see more of his fast-talking low life's. Pulp Fiction is no different and is now widely considered a cinematic classic. It received 7 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Director and one for each of it's leading trio of actors in Travolta, Thurman and Jackson. It walked away with the Best Screenplay award and it won the coveted Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. On this evidence alone, it's hard to argue that Tarantino not only delivered on, but surpassed, his early promise.In L.A.'s criminal underworld, the lives and stories of the inhabitants intertwine. There are two hitmen with very different outlooks, a boxer forced to take a dive for the money, a gangster's moll who likes to dance and do drugs and many others who play a part in shaping their redemptive paths.\"...a shapeless mass of matter\" or \"a magazine or book containing lurid subject matter...\". These are the definitions of the word \"Pulp\" which we are provided with before the film even begins. As a result, Tarantino's masterpiece is self-referential from the opening title card. What follows is only proof of his intentions to recreate the trashy and hardboiled pulp novels of the early 20th century. Even the film's poster reflects the sensational cover art of these novels and it's this attention to detail that's often overlooked in Tarantino's homage to a bygone age. I suppose it's understandable that these details are overlooked considering Tarantino's highly stylish approach. He employs his (now common) nonlinear storylines and chapters, his abundantly original cast of characters and his dialogue has rarely been sharper. Quite honestly, he takes great pride in making pop-cultural references but the film itself has nowhere red the very pop-culture it revels in. To this day, it's endlessly quoted and few, if any, will ever frown at you inquisitively if you were to make a Pulp Fiction reference.It's not just the one-liners, the observant monologues or the endless back and forth, intelligent and philosophical discussions between the characters, it's the fact that snippets of dialogue actually matter in terms of the overall structure. Something can be flippantly mentioned one minute only for it to resurface with relevance at a later part in the film. Ultimately, it's the dialogue that brings every strand together and it's, quite simply, masterfully assembled. To embody his colourful characters, Tarantino assembles his most impressive cast yet. Considering his relative obscurity at the time, it was a bit of a gamble to have John Travolta headline the whole affair as hitman Vincent Vega (the brother of Michael Madsen's Vic Vega from Reservoir Dogs) but I don't think I'd be alone in saying that it was a welcome return to scintillating form. Uma Thurman also impresses as Mia, the coke snorting gangster's moll who seems ill at ease with all the violence and whispers that surround her no-nonsense kingpin husband Marsellus Wallace (a brilliant Ving Rhames). Even the limited acting skills of Bruce Willis are all but forgotten as the self-important, ageing pugilist, Butch Coolidge (a role originally offered to Mickey Rourke and Matt Dillon) but the real prize possession would have to be Samuel L. Jackson's Jules Winnfield, Vincent's unhinged partner who likes to quote passages from the bible and believes in divine intervention. There are so many great performances that it's hard to mention them all. From top to bottom, the whole cast bring Tarantino's dialogue to life; from the aforementioned main performers to the supporting likes of Christopher Walken's Captain Koons who hid an uncomfortable watch \"up his ass\" for 2 years to Zed and Maynard - Peter Greene and Duane Whitaker's white trash who like to \"bring out the gimp\" and sodomise their captives. There's even a character who only gets mentioned by name but still makes an impression:  Antwone Rockamora, brilliantly nicknamed \"Tony Rocky Horror\" who's mentioned in an unforgettable, lengthy discussion on the sexual implications of massaging a woman's feet and whether it's in the same ballpark as \"sticking your tongue in the holiest of the holies\". So iconic are these characters and blackly comic dialogue that most will know exactly what I'm talking about without me having to elaborate and therein lies the sheer joy and richness of the film.From illuminated McGuffins to Big Kahuna Burgers, Pulp Fiction is one of a kind. It redefined the crime film with it's emphasis on cool and endlessly quotable dialogue and there's so much attention to characterisation that Tarantino could have made several films from his material. Watching \"a bunch of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangster shit\" has never been more enjoyable.

The first time I saw this I was 17 years old and asked my parents what \"Reservoir Dogs\" was about because I heard that the \"Du Hast\" video by Rammstein was based on that movie.  They told me about it, and it sounded amazing.  So I went up to broadway video(only Paris people will remember that glorious video store) and rented \"Dogs\" and \"Pulp Fiction\" on VHS. I didn't know if I would watch \"Fiction\" or not, but I saw the same guy directed both, so I figured I would check it out just in case.  I watched \"Dogs\" and was in love and as soon as it ended I popped \"Fiction\" in.  From the opening scene I knew I was watching something special, something amazing, and a movie that I would never forget.  I watched it again the next day(something I rarely ever do), and then a few days later I bought them both on DVD(all I had was a PS2 and didn't use it very much).  I have watched \"Fiction\" countless times since and have the entire movie basically memorized.  I've boughtt it again on a 2 disc DVD and then last year I bout it on blu ray.  Last night was the first time I got around to watching it on Blu Ray, and my god the movie pops and comes to life like I hadn't seen.  From the color of Vincent's car to the sweat on Jules head it just make this feel like a new movie.  It had been a couple years since I just sat down and watched this all the way through, and the movie still feels insanely fresh, innovative, and special.  I was still on the edge when Mia gets her adrenaline shot.  I was still shocked when Zed brings out the gimp and I still laughed at how crazy Honey Bunny gets after being so damn sweet. This movie is an extreme movie as you either love it or hate it(I know people that are on both sides), and I absolutely love it.  If rotten tomatoes would let me I'd give it 10 stars, because no other movie comes close to giving the amazing experience that \"Pulp Fiction\" is able to give.  I've introduced this movie to quite a few people and it's a movie that when Grant comes of age, I can't wait to show him.  If you have never seen this, this I strongly, strongly recommend you rent/download/borrow a copy, set aside 3 hours and just prepare to get your mind blown.  If you have seen this, this go back and watch again.

Since its release in 1994, the film has become nothing short of legendary; some may feel its praise from hipsters and venerable critics alike is undue, but I don't think it is. The film's non-linear narrative is so strong, so rich; it keeps you thoroughly engaged and develops the characters in such a way that you begin to run through your head the chronology of the characters' stories, making sense of Tarantino's and Avary's complex script. This complexity makes 'Pulp Fiction' endlessly re-watchable, I have seen it many times, and recently I was lucky enough to catch a screening at the Duke of York's Picturehouse in Brighton, which was an experience that reminded me of how special this film is.  \r\r'Pulp Fiction' explores the following principal characters: Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, a pair of loquacious hitmen who appear to exist in a style vacuum; Butch Coolidge, an aging but courageous prize fighter; Marcellus Wallace, a seemingly omnipotent mobster and Mia Wallace, the flirtatious wife of Mr. Wallace whom Vincent Vega is assigned to take out to dinner. The characters' stories famously clash with each other, regularly to chaotic and hilarious effect.\rTarantino is yet to return to this kind of form. \r\rAfter 'Jackie Brown' in 1998, he spent time making the entertaining but comparably meagre 'Kill Bill' films, which were well orchestrated viscera, but ultimately below him. He then made 'Death Proof', which was an offensively bad, juvenile piece of work with a script of unprecedented annoyance. However, Tarantino made a comeback with 'Inglourious Basterds', which had a rather appealing premise and many memorable scenes. 2013 sees the launch of 'Django Unchained', which, with its ensemble cast and inevitable flair, is one of the most exciting films of the year. \r\r'Pulp Fiction' has all the components of a classic, it has the scope and the quality, it is within the bracket of films such as 'The Godfather', 'Goodfellas' and 'Citizen Kane', films that will be revisited by audiences forever, films that are firmly considered as 'required viewing'.", :title=>nil, :location=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"rotten_tomatoes", :url=>"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pulp_fiction/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"'Pulp Fiction' is a film with not a flaw worth mentioning, if there are any, that is.", :clean_text=>"'pulp fiction is a film with not a flaw worth mentioning if there are any that is.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"Since its release in 1994, the film has become nothing short of legendary; some may feel its praise from hipsters and venerable critics alike is undue, but I don't think it is.", :clean_text=>"since its release in 1994 the film has become nothing short of legendary some may feel its praise from hipsters and venerable critics alike is undue but i don't think it is.", :sentiment=>1, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>2, :text=>"The film's non-linear narrative is so strong, so rich; it keeps you thoroughly engaged and develops the characters in such a way that you begin to run through your head the chronology of the characters' stories, making sense of Tarantino's and Avary's complex script.", :clean_text=>"the film's non-linear narrative is so strong so rich it keeps you thoroughly engaged and develops the characters in such a way that you begin to run through your head the chronology of the characters stories making sense of tarantino's and avary's complex script.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{:plot=>65, :dialog=>50}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>3, :text=>"This complexity makes 'Pulp Fiction' endlessly re-watchable, I have seen it many times, and recently I was lucky enough to catch a screening at the Duke of York's Picturehouse in Brighton, which was an experience that reminded me of how special this film is.", :clean_text=>"this complexity makes pulp fiction endlessly re-watchable i have seen it many times and recently i was lucky enough to catch a screening at the duke of york's picturehouse in brighton which was an experience that reminded me of how special this film is.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>4, :text=>"'Pulp Fiction' explores the following principal characters: Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, a pair of loquacious hitmen who appear to exist in a style vacuum; Butch Coolidge, an aging but courageous prize fighter; Marcellus Wallace, a seemingly omnipotent mobster and Mia Wallace, the flirtatious wife of Mr. Wallace whom Vincent Vega is assigned to take out to dinner.", :clean_text=>"'pulp fiction explores the following principal characters vincent vega and jules winnfield a pair of loquacious hitmen who appear to exist in a style vacuum butch coolidge an aging but courageous prize fighter marcellus wallace a seemingly omnipotent mobster and mia wallace the flirtatious wife of mr wallace whom vincent vega is assigned to take out to dinner.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{:plot=>50}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>["John Travolta", "Samuel L.
