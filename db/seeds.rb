The best thing about this movie, for me, was the flashback sequences to Vito's early years, how he ended up living in America, how he got started in the mafia, how he made his first (I presume it was his first) kill, how he set up his most important element: Family. The absence of Marlon Brando is evident here, but its made up for as we have Robert De Niro playing the young Don Corleone. There is a vast difference between Michael and his deceased father, Vito. Vito immensly loved his family and it was evident that family was the most important thing to him. To Michael, that is not true. Note how he smacks Kay across the face, how he refuses to let her see his children, how he orders the execution of his brother Fredo. The final scene, where we got a flashback to the family at the table for Vitos surprise party, is quite a well executed scene, and it was interesting to see the familys reaction to Michael joining the Marines and that it was Sonny who introduced the despicable wife beater Carlo to Connie.

If one looks back at that wonderful decade of cinema, he or she would see 'Colossal' films like Taxi Driver, Apocalypse Now, Annie Hall, Means Streets, Jaws, Chinatown, The Godfather (Its Predecessor) and many more. But, I think, the film which captures 6 Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Art-Direction and Best Actor in a Supporting Role) surpasses them all, and that film is The Godfather Part II. To begin with it's acting would be a pleasure to me. \"Sun rising to shine the world\" That would be the expression to depict it's masterful acting. Well supported by it's supporting players and that include Robert Duvall (extremely impressive), John Cazale, Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo. Al Pacino plays the cold Michael Corleone, who's delivery entertained me with some kind of realism. Just rightfully perfect, I could conclude that he's transformed or easily put, Al gives a perfect performance which deserved an Oscar for best performance of the year. Just somewhere in that corner of brilliance, one could see a composed acting of Robert Deniro as young Vito Corleone. It is like pure cloud gathering all around him, truly an unforgettable contribution. In summary, it could be commented that this piece is a well acted motion picture. The element which grasped my attention is Coppola's method of slow or methodical filmmaking which captures the beauty of this cinema. Beautifully shot from start to finish, it is a breathtaking sight of grandeur. This film is a cleverly written piece too. Completed with inspiring dialogue, attractive epic storytelling and it could be easily 'snatched'that it is masterful. Many would disagree with me because I'm going to, or will always name this picture as 'The Greatest Film Ever Made'.

The film focuses on the twin stories of Michael Corleone's attempt to consolidate his power as Godfather of the Corleone family by, as he puts it, killing all his enemies.  The latter primarily include a Jewish gangster who was a former associate of his father as a young man, a former associate who turns government witness, and his brother Fredo, who betrays Michael because he felt passed over and because in betraying Michael there would be \"something in it for me.\"  The other story told is that of the youth and young manhood of Vito Corleone, magnificently portrayed by Robert De Niro in one of his greatest performances, performing his role in Italian and doing a masterful job of mimicking Marlon Brando's intonations from the previous film.  The story takes him from his earlier childhood, with the death of all the members of his family in Sicily, to his immigration to the United States, and eventual involvement in a life of organized crime.Much of the power of the second film comes from the contrast between the two stories.  As Vito Corleone grows in power, he also grows as a family man, in both the sense of a father with children and a wife and in the extended sense in his role as Godfather.  He becomes the center of a community, drawing others around him.  But the other story, of the decay of all that Vito had built up through the leadership of Michael, betrays all the realities undergirding the delusions riddling Vito Corleone's Family.  The rot and decay that characterizes Michael's reign are shown as the natural and inescapable result of the greed that drove the lives of those in the crime organization.  Nonetheless, the contrast between Vito, surrounded by friends and family and associates, and Michael, killing friends and associates and even family members, alienating even his most loyal friends, sitting inside his armed compound alone couldn't be starker.  There is a reverse symmetry between the two stories:  Vito starts off alone and ends surrounded by family and friends, while Michael starts off surrounded with family and friends, and ends up alone.  This is symbolized perfectly in the final scene in the film, in a flashback to December 7, 1941, when Michael reveals to his brothers that he has enlisted in the Army.  They hear their father arrive elsewhere in the house and rush off to meet him, only Michael sitting at the table alone as the film ends.As with the first film, the acting is beyond reproach.  As great as Al Pacino has been in his career, Michael Corleone has been his greatest achievement.  He and Robert De Niro excel in the two key roles in the film.  Lee Strasberg came out of retirement to play Hyman Roth, and he was extraordinarily effective in the role.  The late, great John Cazale was marvelously timid as the dim, confused, and indecisive Fredo, who both adored and resented his brother Michael.  Michael Gazzo is unforgettable as Frank Pentangeli, who thinks he has been betrayed by Michael and turns government witness, and received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for his performance (he was beaten out by Robert De Niro), as was Lee Strasberg.  Robert Duvall returns as Tom Hagen, who is more loyal to Michael than anyone else but who Michael distrusts nonetheless.  Bizarrely, Al Pacino lost out to Art Carney, who was excellent in the rather minor film HARRY AND TONTO.  It is hard today to understand how Pacino failed to win.", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[74, 82], :date=>" 2003 June 3", :title=>"An extraordinary sequel to a great American classic

history that are as revered as \"The Godfather\".  There are so many memorable performances and so many memorable scenes that there's no dispute over it sitting in the #1 All-Time position on the Internet Movie Database's (IMDB) Top 250 list.  Normally, trying to follow up such a cinematic masterpiece with a sequel is a foolhardy endeavor.  The performances and brilliant storytelling tend to falter in the next movie.  Seldom does a drama produce a worthy sequel.  In the case of \"The Godfather\", it easily produced the 'sequel that is equal' with \"...Part II\".  Listed in the #3 slot in the IMDB Top 250 All-Time, \"The Godfather, Part II\" is an even more ambitious film than the original.  So ambitious, in fact, that many fans of the \"Godfather\" films feel it may actually be superior to the original.  I do not share that opinion.  At best, I feel it is just as good as the original.  At worst, it is just a tiny bit less of a film than \"...Part I\".  I feel that, while \"...Part II\" is more ambitious, it lacks the grand scale of the original, especially in the scenes involving Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) control of the family 'business' in the late 1950's.  This is hardly a criticism, though.  In fact, the lack of grand scale of this 'family' is symbolic of how Michael's chilling rule has wrecked was the family once was, instead of being indicative of lackluster filmmaking.  Director Francis Ford Coppola took a risky, but ultimately reward, approach to the story of \"The Godfather, Part II\".  He wanted to tell the story of a young Vito Corleone's (played by Robert DeNiro here) rise to power simultaneously with his son Michael's fall from grace some 40 years apart.  The two parallel stories have a marvelous interplay with one another.  At no point, when film shifts from one time period to the other, does it feel forced or jarring.  There is always some sort of connection, however subtle, between the end of a scene in one time period and the beginning of one in the other.  The story of the young Vito Corleone begins in 1901 in Sicily at the funeral for his father who murdered for an insult to local Mafia chieftain.  His mother, who lost her other son when he was killed trying to avenge his father, visits the chieftain, Don Ciccio, in an attempt to spare the life of her youngest, 'dumb-witted' son, Vito.  When Ciccio refuses, she attempts to murder him and winds up being killed herself.  Vito runs away and, with the help of friends of the family, avoids capture by Ciccio's men and is placed on a ship to America.  A leap forward to 1958 shows Vito's grandson, Anthony receiving his first Communion and the subsequent reception afterwards at Michael Corleone's Lake Tahoe compound, where Michael receives visitors and requests for favors much the same way Vito did on his daughter's wedding at the beginning of the original \"Godfather\".  Each story, on it's own, is quite fascinating.  Weaved together, they are magnificent.  The tale of Vito Corleone shows his rise from being just another Italian immigrant to becoming one of the most powerful underworld figures in New York and the strengthening of the Corleone family.  In contrast, the tale of Michael Corleone shows the disintegration of his family and his 'family' as a result of his cold, iron-fisted leadership and paranoia over any betrayals, either real or perceived.  The very end of Michael Corleone story shows the depressingly haunting image of Michael sitting amongst the fallen leaves of fall with only the 'button' men around him in the compound, as he has pushed away every single person who was close to him.  It's a tragic ending of Shakespearean proportions in direct contrast to the seemingly boundless future that seems to await the Corleone's at the end of the Vito Corleone story.  As with the original \"Godfather\", the performances in \"...Part II\" are nothing short of spectacular.  Pacino chillingly portrays Michael Corleone's continued decent into evil.  The progression of his character from the war hero who wanted nothing to do with the family business (in \"...Part I\") to the most ruthless of mafia leaders (in \"...Part II\") is truly disturbing.  Pacino makes Michael the embodiment of pure evil.  Not even his wife or his children (or even his brother) are safe from his wrath.  The fact that he didn't win a Best Actor Oscar for this performance is almost as criminal as the Corleone family business.  Robert DeNiro gives an equally accomplished performance as a young Vito Corleone (who was played by Marlon Brando in the original movie).  The mannerisms and demeanor that DeNiro brings to his portrayal of a young Vito leave the audience completely convinced that this is how Vito looked and acted at this age.  Unlike Pacino, though, DeNiro was not overlooked for his performance and won an Oscar for Best Support Actor.  There are other remarkable performances throughout the film.  Among them are Robert Duvall reprising his role as the loyal, but wary, 'adopted brother' Tom Hagen; Lee Strasberg (the creator of \"method acting\") as Michael's nefarious business partner, Hyman Roth (and target of Michael's famous phrase, \"Keep your friends close, but your enemies even closer\"); and John Cazale as the weak, easily-manipulated Fredo Corleone who gets himself into trouble way over his head.  Few sequels are able to match the acclaim and accomplishment of their predecessor, but \"The Godfather, Part II\" manages to achieve this in epic fashion.  While I still hold to my claim that the original \"Godfather\" was the better of the two films, there is no doubt in my mind that this exists as one of the 10 best films of all-time.", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[15, 17], :date=>" 2003 February 12", :title=>"Epic Sequel that is Equal to original", :location=>"(Silver Spring, MD)", :username=>"Patrick L.

Just as compelling as the first one and in some ways even better.  This is the work of a more mature and focused director, Coppola had grown a  lot as a filmmaker since the first `Godfather' film. More ambitious,  focused, dark and just as powerful and enthralling. It lacks the nostalgia  from the first film, but then this is a much darker film with more ground  to cover. Pacino is truly mesmerizing as the now power-hungry Michael  Corleone, he created one of the most famous and compelling characters in  film history. His performance here is much more complex than in the first  one, Michael goes through one of the most astonishing psychological  transformations of any character in film history. In one of his definitive  roles, Pacino delivers one of the key performances of the 70's and  certainly the best in his career. Just a impressive is Robert DeNiro as  Vito Corleone as a young man, Coppola couldn't have said it better `I saw  DeNiro maybe not as Marlon Brando as a young man but Vito Corleone as a  young man'. DeNiro is best remembered for his roles in Scorsese's pictures  but his performance in this film is almost just as good and ranks among his  best. Virtuoso acting at it's best and even more impressive is that he  mastered the Italian language. Robert Duvall is also great as Tom Hagen,  even though he gets no big scenes. John Cazale's character Fredo Corleone,  who played a small part in the first one, was further developed in this  film. Cazale is as efficient a he can be as Fredo and the scene where  Michael tells Fredo he doesn't want to see him anymore is simply  spellbinding, among the best scenes ever filmed. Talia Shire's character  Connie was also further developed and has some great scenes, namely when he  asks Michael to forgive Fredo, a coldly calculated scene that features  bravura directing by Coppola and showcases his talents at their best. Diane  Keaton also gets a great scene where she tells Michael about the abortion,  another powerhouse scene. Lee Strasberg, who was also one of the most  celebrated acting teachers in the world, agreed to star as Hyman Roth, a  meticulously calculated performance but expect no less from one of the  great acting masters. Michael V. Gazzo is brilliant as Pentangeli, a  supporting performance that well deserves to be compared with DeNiro's or  Strasberg's. Filled with as many memorable supporting characters as in the  first one, I will name only a few: Senator Pat Geary (G.D. Spradlin),  Fanucci (Gastone Moschin), young Clemenza (Bruno Kirby), Johnny Ola  (Dominic Chianese), Al Neri (Richard Bright) are only a few. Th direction  by Coppola is truly masterful. What makes the `Godfather' films the  timeless classics that they are is that they have so many great scenes.  There's never a scene put of place, not a bum performance in the whole cast  and near flawless directing, acting and writing. And `The Godfather Part  II' has more that it's share of great scenes, so many memorable lines and  so many classic scenes it's hard to name them all. This time the score was  by Coppola's father Carmine Coppola. He took the nostalgic theme of Nino  Rota's original score and added a darker tone to it. The score is dazzling  and fits perfectly into this classic film. The screenplay is masterful in  itself. The script is an original screenplay but still it won the Oscar for  best `Adapted Screenplay', but then again the competition was heavy with  the Original Screenplays that year including Robert Towne's script for  `Chinatown', which is a milestone. And to top it all off, the movie ends  with one of the most deeply haunting endings ever filmed, with a close shot  of a grayed-hair Michael dealing with his ghosts. `The Godfather Part II',  along with the first `Godfather' ranks right on top among the best films  ever made. And this is a more complex and dark film, less nostalgic of  course but more professional and focused. A unique treat that should be  tasted by every filmgoer and cherished by all who love great movies.  Extras: Danny Aiello, who would later play the Don in Puzo's `The Last  Don', a much weaker film, appears in a small cameo. From a scale of 1-10 I  give this film a 10!

differences between the two heads of the family, Vito and Michael. The movie begins in 1901 with Vito being a child with his mother begging for his life in Sicily right after his father and brother were killed. Vito narrowly escapes that dark Sicilian scene after his mother's death to an overwhelmingly bright America. The lighting in the scenes, especially the first and last, help portray the deeper, more emotional side of the Corleone family. The scene in Sicily was made out to be a dark place full of deceit, where as when Vito first came to America it was extremely bright- a symbol for hope and goodness. Vito worked hard for the American dream, but remembered his Italian heritage. In this part it was made clear why it was so important to Vito in the original to have friendship because many people helped him out when he first arrived in the United States. Vito worked hard to become what he became while earning the respect of many.  The history of Vito is intertwined with that of Michael's life in 1958. As Michael loses more and more family members he changes for the worse. He lives for a life of action and reaction in the world of revenge. This is such a major change from the first film. Who would have thought that Michael would have turned out the way that he did? To change from a respectable military man who fought valiantly for his country to the head of the Corleone mafia family. Another strong theme in this movie was the loyalty issue. Everyone thought that they could double cross Michael and get away with it because didn't truly earn the position of \"Don,\" it was just bestowed upon him by his father. That in its own respect made Michael turn out to be a little unforgiving. The acting in this film was truly superior to any other movie out there. Talia Shire played the part of Connie Corleone phenomenally. In a scene near the beginning where she is asking Michael for money you can feel her uneasiness. The part of Tom Hagen was a tricky one because throughout the whole movie you aren't sure what side anyone is on(especially Tom) and Robert Duvall played it perfectly. John Cazale played Fredo Corleone, the imbecile who no matter how hard he tried, couldn't get a thing right. First he makes you laugh, then he makes you hate him, then he makes you feel sorry for him. The role of Kay Corleone is played by Diane Keaton who gives a better performance than in the first. This can be plainly seen in every scene that she has with Michael because you can actually feel her pain. Robert De Niro plays the young Vito and does it with a lot of spunk, there is no doubt this man is an Oscar winner. The best performance of the whole movie is that of Al Pacino playing the ever changing role of Michael Corleone. Pacino proves he is a very versatile actor changing from warm, honest, and loyal in the original to cold, unforgiving, and suspicious in the second.

:emphasis=>2.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}]}, {:content=>"Despite its status as arguably the best movie sequel of all time, \"The Godfather: Part II\" is in some ways quite formulaic.  Following a rigid template he set up in \"The Godfather: Part I\", Francis Ford Coppola has once again fashioned a story that begins with a festival, features a failed attempt on the Don's life, and offers as a turning point the murder of an untouchable power figure.  It repeats successful motifs, and, while being less easily quotable, is composed of a very specific kind of language that lets you know the world into which you've entered.The biggest difference, though, is the inclusion of flashbacks to Vito Corleone's early life.  These scenes, taken from Mario Puzo's original novel, let Coppola indulge an idea he had for another movie, to tell parallel stories of a father and a son at the same age.  Far from an indulgence, though, these scenes do wonders in terms of fleshing out the history of the Corleone family.  It drapes a more tragic pall over the story, for it becomes clear that Michael Corleone's fate, one that robs him of his soul and leaves him alone and heartbroken, could not have been avoided.Robert De Niro plays young Vito.  When his job at a local grocery is given to the nephew of the neighbourhood boss, one Don Fanucci, Vito must turn to crime to support his family.  The scenes with Fanucci, played with broad flair by Gastone Moschin, are impressive.  For despite the power and style and fear embodied by the older man, Vito always looks to be in control.  Much of the credit should go to De Niro, who was at the time shifting his career into a higher gear that would eventually lead him to Travis Bickle.  He is at his best here when the scene calls for silence, displaying a whimsical grace that hides his violent nature.  When he opens his mouth to speak it sounds an awful lot like the kind of Marlon-Brando-as-The-Godfather impression you've heard a million times.If the flashback scenes didn't mesh perfectly with the contemporary scenes, Coppola's little gimmick would seem redundant.  Using a variety of devices, the past and the present mesh perfectly into one movie.The other half of the movie, set in the late-1950s and early-1960s, is epic in scope where the first half was small and personal.  Despite the globetrotting antics of the story, it's still a tale of one individual's road to perdition.Without his father and brother around to steal the spotlight, Michael Corleone firmly establishes himself as the key piece of \"The Godfather\" puzzle.  Gone, however, is the innocent Joe College of the first film, replaced by a detached and Machiavellian man.  He's reached the top of the mountain, only to find it a place cold enough to freeze your heart, and lonely enough that you must look inward for solace.  It is the internal nature of Michael's character that defines how this story will be told.  Many of the killings are hidden, obstructed.  \"Part I\" featured elaborate homicidal set-pieces, each culminating in a charismatic and compelling murder.  \"Part II\" does no such thing.  Instead of allowing us to see the bullet enter the eye, or the piano wire go around the neck, we get one murder partially hidden by wind-blown drapery, an attempted smothering that takes place behind closed doors, a suicide shown only in aftermath tableau, and finally a judicious edit, cutting away from the horrible act, to reveal who is really being destroyed by the final killing.  Coppola, whose desire to make a personal film is more evident here than in \"Part I\" (which is, in comparison, almost a popcorn gobbling blockbuster), exhibits artful taste in the way he tells the story.A story, which rides on the shoulders of Al Pacino.  His portrayal of Michael Corleone, to me, is his best work.  It is the template for every great performance he will give in its wake: quiet, brooding, and all the while repressing the vaunted Pacino rage.  The Michael Corleone of \"Part II\" is a more mysterious man, a less joyous man, and a more vengeful man.Despite Michael's (and Al's) ascension to prominence, I always find Fredo to be a more intriguing character.  Relegated to a few undignified scenes in \"Part I\", Fredo doesn't come off much better here.  He's still the simplest of the Corleone boys, a condition now explained by a childhood sickness in the flashback scenes.  But despite his deficiencies it is Fredo, knowingly or otherwise, who comes closest to taking The Godfather down.  John Cazale, who played Fredo, does a remarkable job portraying the man's joie de vivre, his melancholy, and his self-awareness.  In Cazale's hands Fredo knows that he will never reach the heights of his brothers, a fact that more or less defines his existence.  \"You're my kid brother,\" he incredulously tells Michael, \"and you take care of me?\"A couple of newcomers are added to the mix, livening up an already tasty stew.  Michael V. Gazzo, as underboss Frankie Pentangeli, brings a welcome dose of humour and brashness to the proceedings.  His distinctive voice and broad gesticulations make him a wonderful character to watch.  The other newcomer who makes his mark is legendary acting teacher Lee Strasberg, who plays Hyman Roth.  Sickly and old, Strasberg still manages to imbue Roth with a sense of the man's former vitality, and his current bulldogedness.  Strasberg never makes bold choices (as opposed to Gazzo, who is all bold choices), but his quiet tenacity is a perfect match for the same quality Pacino brings to Michael.At well over 3 hours long, \"The Godfather: Part II\" would be a torturous chore if it weren't such a fully-packed delight.  Every scene is relevant to the plot, suspenseful, and wonderfully artistic.  Coppola had an arduous task in trying to top the first \"Godfather\".

Partly taken from Mario Puzo's novel and partly original (Coppola and Puzo share screenplay credit), this three hour and 20 minute combination gangster epic and Americana saga takes us from 1901 Ellis Island to Lake Tahoe in the late 1950s.  We open with the child Vito Corleone (who will grow up to be the Brando patriarch of the 1972 film) fleeing Sicily after his mother and brother are assassinated.  Vito arrives safely at Ellis Island.Cut to sun-drenched Lake Tahoe with Vito's adult son Michael (Al Pacino in the performance of his career to date) hosting one of the most lavish and romantic wedding parties in movie history.  But then we cut inside the boathouse, where sinister actions and killings are being planned by Michael and G.D. Spradlin as the oily Nevada governor.  The Corleones want a controlling interest in Vegas and Tahoe gambling.  Note the fabulous Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola music outside in the bright sunshine contrasted by ace cinematographer Gordon Willis' use of dark shadows and low light inside.  (Location filming was done at the beautiful Getty Estate on the deep blue lake.  I heard a terribly sad story that Willis was denied two Oscar nominations for GODFATHER I and II because the old guard inside the cinematography guild thought he was a youthful student who did not know to turn up the lighting!  He finally got nominated for GODFATHER III after people in the Academy realized he was a maestro with light and shadow and color quality.)Throughout the immense and hugely engrossing 200 minute running time of GODFATHER II, Coppola and  three credited film editors (Barry Malkin, Peter Zinner, and Richard Marks) cut back and forth between the young Vito Corleone  (an Oscar-winning Robert De Niro speaking only Sicilian with subtitles) in 1910's Little Italy; and his son Michael involved in gambling from 1950's Tahoe  to Miami to the Dominican Republic.  Linking the material is the last scene in the distant past, as Michael kills the mafioso who murdered his father's mother in the opening scene.  I really wish there could be a GODFATHER IV to show how the young Michael leaving Sicily in 1930 became Vito Corleone's adult son in the 1945 Brooklyn of the opening scene of the first movie.  What happened to the Corleone family during the Depression and World War Two?  When you see the first two movies recut chronologically, there is a gaping continuity hole here.Dean Tavoularis' production design and Theodora Van Runkle's costumes are stupendous, capturing both the 1910's Little Italy and the myriad 1950's locales.  Tavoularis re-decorated existing streets in lower Manhattan to look like the 1910-1930 era, then took on the challenge of Miami and Cuba in the 1950's, including a lavish hotel party with fabulous music by, I think, Carmine Coppola; Carmine did the incidental music, while Nino Rota did the incomparable background score.  And cinematographer Gordon Willis, one of the world's great lighting cameramen, sets up stunning visual contrasts between sepia and gas-lit Little Italy, and sun-drenched Tahoe and Cuba.  I do not have enough praise for everyone who made this movie, on both sides of the camera.  It is certainly helpful to have Francis Coppola's audio commentary identifying all of the background character actors and noting how smoothly the mammoth 104 day shoot all over the world went, in contrast to the disastrous first film behind the scenes.Diane Keaton and Robert Duvall do not get enough credit in this review.  They add a lot of flavoring, Keaton as Michael's second wife until a brutal flare-up 2/3 of the way through; and Duvall as the family lawyer.  Watch GODFATHER: PART THREE (1990), where Duvall's absence is sorely missed (contract negotiation matters) and Keaton is back on good terms with Michael.  Pacino's Michael in Part Two rots before our eyes, especially if you watch the two lengthy films on DVD on two consecutive evenings.  At the end of Part One, Michael has his sister's (Talia Shire) husband murdered.  In Part Two, Shire is heavily rouged with furs and endless cigarettes.  And Michael has brother Fredo (the neglected and excellent John Cazale, who died much too young in real life) killed in a boat on an Autumn Lake Tahoe.It's a titanic film, maybe one of my five favorites in the American cinema, and Coppola's masterpiece among masterpieces.  I haven't even mentioned Michael V. Gazzo, playwright turned actor as a nervous Mafia hood named Frankie  Plantagalee; and legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg as a fictional version of Meyer Lansky, who wants to live in retirement in Miami with his wife.  Both Gazzo and Strasberg got Supporting Actor Oscar nominations, playing vivid characters who will not survive to the ending credits.This enthralling, and admittedly very violent in spots (especially the final reel) gangster film/Americana epic ends where it really began--at the Getty Estate on Lake Tahoe.  It is Autumn with an empty lake and lots of leaves on the ground.  Michael has had everyone else killed one by one and is all alone in a chair, pensive, ponderng his whole life.  The first movie was made only two years earlier, in 1972, but Michael seems a good thirty years older here.  Cue Nino Rota's incomparable music score after maybe a full minute of silence, then a longer than usual black fadeout, then roll the end credits.  Man, I adore this movie!  Please, please, do not stay away from it because of the violence--and for heaven's sake take two nights if you need two nights for the 200 minute length.  THE GODFATHER: PART  TWO is one for the ages, a motion picture that everyone connected with can be extraordinarily proud of, now and forever.

It is in a sense a voyeuristic\ndelight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of\nthe family. It single-handedly change the world's view of organized crime,\nand created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of\ncommon morality. It was the highest grossing movie of its time and Brando\ncreated a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it\ndid\nin 1972.As extraordinary an achievement as this is, Part II is even better. It\neasily receives my nod as the best picture ever made. I have seen it at\nleast 20 times, and each time its 200 minutes fly by.The movie uses flashbacks to brilliantly weave two tales. The main story\nis\nthe reign of Michael Corleone as the world's most powerful criminal. Now\nreaping the benefits of legalized gambling in Las Vegas, Michael is an\nevident billionaire with an iron fist on a world of treachery.Behind this, Director Francis Ford Coppola spins the tale of the rise of\nMichael's father, Vito, to the center of the New York mafia. It is these\nscenes that make the film a work of art. Without spoiling, I will simply\nsay\nthe Robert DeNiro as the young Vito is the best acting performance of all\ntime, a role  for which he won a richly deserved Oscar.The screenplay is full of delicious little underworld nuggets (\"Keep your\nfriends close .....\", \"I don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies\"),\nwhile it blows a dense, twisted plot past you at a dizzying and merciless\npace. The cinematography is depressing and atmospheric. The score\ncontinues\nin the eerie role of its predecessor, foretelling death and\nevil.All of this makes the movie great and infinitely watchable. But it's\nwhat's\ndeeper inside this film ... what it is really about ... that is its true\ngenius.The Godfather Part II is not really a movie about the mafia, it is a movie\nabout a man's life long struggle. Michael controls a vast empire that is\nconstantly slipping out of his hands. He grows increasingly distrustful\nand\nparanoid, and even shows signs that he hates his own life.

A faultless, flawless gripping drama; Coppola's second part\nof his crime saga is in my opinion one of the top 5 films of all time\nand perhaps towering over the first part. \"As close to perfection as movies get\"\"Pacino at his best\"-10/10-\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071562/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"\nThe Godfather Part II (1974)Number 1 - 1974Top 3 - 1970s\"My father taught me many things.", :clean_text=>"the godfather part ii 1974)number 1 1974top 3 1970s\"my father taught me many things.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"Keep your friends close but keep your\nenemies closer\"\"The Godfather Part II is truly a masterpiece.", :clean_text=>"keep your friends close but keep your enemies closer\"\"the godfather part ii is truly a masterpiece.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>2.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>2, :text=>"Timeless, Classic,\nBeautiful and endlessly watchable\"The second part of Francis Ford Coppola's Epic and violent Gangster\nTrilogy, follows the reign of Don Michael Corleone as the head of the\nCorleone family.", :clean_text=>"timeless classic beautiful and endlessly watchable\"the second part of francis ford coppola's epic and violent gangster trilogy follows the reign of don michael corleone as the head of the corleone family.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{:vision=>20}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>["Al Pacino", "Francis Ford Coppola"], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>3, :text=>"As well the film shows us the early years of Vito\nCorleone (Marlon Brando) played flawlessly by Academy Award Winner\nRobert De Niro, and how he created his empire of money, gambling and\nrespect.", :clean_text=>"as well the film shows us the early years of vito corleone marlon brando played flawlessly by academy award winner robert de niro and how he created his empire of money gambling and respect.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{:cast=>70}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>["Robert De Niro"], :people_indexes=>[["Robert De Niro", [[117]]]]}, {:index=>4, :text=>"Beautifully directed by Francis Ford Coppola, Godfather Part\nII exceeds every expectation with outstanding performances from Academy\nAward winners Al Pacino,Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and Robert De Niro.", :clean_text=>"beautifully directed by francis ford coppola godfather part ii exceeds every expectation with outstanding performances from academy award winners al pacino,diane keaton robert duvall and robert de niro.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>2.0, :people_tags=>["Al Pacino", "Robert De Niro", "Robert Duvall", "Diane Keaton", "Francis Ford Coppola"], :people_indexes=>[["Al Pacino", [[147]]], ["Robert De Niro", [[180]]], ["Robert Duvall", [[162]]], ["Diane Keaton", [[148]]]]}, {:index=>5, :text=>"The second part of this unforgettable trilogy is one of the finest\nfilms ever made.", :clean_text=>"the second part of this unforgettable trilogy is one of the finest films ever made.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>6, :text=>"This is cinematic art.", :clean_text=>"this is cinematic art.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>7, :text=>"A treasure of film history.", :clean_text=>"a treasure of film history.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>8, :text=>"The finest sequel\never made.", :clean_text=>"the finest sequel ever made.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>9, :text=>"A faultless, flawless gripping drama; Coppola's second part\nof his crime saga is in my opinion one of the top 5 films of all time\nand perhaps towering over the first part.", :clean_text=>"a faultless flawless gripping drama coppola's second part of his crime saga is in my opinion one of the top 5 films of all time and perhaps towering over the first part.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>10, :text=>"\"As close to perfection as movies get\"\"Pacino at his best\"-10/10-\n", :clean_text=>"\"as close to perfection as movies get\"\"pacino at his best\"-10/10", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}]}, {:rating=>0.9, :percentage=>90.0, :useful=>[144, 223], :title=>"Excellent, but could be in the dictionary under \"sprawl\"", :username=>"Brandt Sponseller", :location=>"from New York City", :date=>"10 May 2005", :content=>"\nSeries note: It is almost unthinkable to watch this film without having\nseen The Godfather (1972) first. This is a direct continuation of that\nstory.The good news is that The Godfather Part II has many amazing qualities,\nincluding fantastic performances from a superb cast, sublime,\nunprecedented visuals that no one else has been able to capture since,\nand very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily\nbeen a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't\npossibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets\ntranscend what's basically a mess overall. Because it should have been\na 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at\nlength, I may pick on more things in my review than you would think I\nwould for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, The Godfather\nPart II is still essential viewing.Director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola cleverly begins the film with\nparallels to The Godfather. We see Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) \"in the\nrole\" of his father, Vito (Marlon Brando), from the first film,\naccepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. Like\nthe first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know\nsome of the principal characters. Perhaps during this segment, perhaps\na bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn't so clever after\nall, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The\nGodfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario\nPuzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.After the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we\nquickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone's mafia\nworld. Michael believes that someone on the \"inside\" was involved with\nthe hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has\nMichael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New\nYork, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the\nattempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all\nbeen part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one\nof the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn't convey Michael's\nunderlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not\nthrough his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set-up, it\nstarts to feel like slightly muddled writing.During the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also\nhave a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast.\nThere are bit too many characters who aren't well enough presented or\nexplained. You may need to keep a scorecard.Coppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended \"flashback\" segments,\nand I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert\nDe Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although\nmaybe that's a bit of my bias creeping in, as I'm a huge De Niro fan.But let's talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl. This is maybe\nfirst evident in the flashbacks. As good as they are, they go on far\ntoo long, and happen far too frequently, to sustain the momentum of\neither the Michael story or the Vito-as-a-youngster story. It begins to\nfeel like we're toggling back and forth between two films, which is the\ntrack that should have been taken. The prequel, at least, would have\nbeen a solid 10.There's also a lot of sprawl in the Michael Corleone segments. Coppola\nappears to have been suffering from what I'd now call \"J.K. Rowling\nSyndrome\". That happens when an artist becomes successful enough that\nthey can fire or ignore their editor(s). Instead of taking good advice\nabout where to trim fat, the artist decides to just leave much of it\nin, and they now have the clout to override any dissenting and more\nsensible opinions. The Michael Corleone story has a lot of fat,\nincluding much of the Cuba material (for example, sitting around the\ntable with the President, laboriously passing around a solid gold\ntelephone), the Senate hearings (which go on far too long to make and\nprovide the dramatic points), and so on.The film begins to feel more like a couple seasons of a television show\nthat Coppola tried to cram into a 3 and a half hour film, or worse, a\ncollection of deleted scenes. The scenes, except for the fat that\nneeded to be trimmed, are excellent in isolation. But by the time the\nclimax rolls around, the whole has more of an arbitrary feeling--this\nis especially clear in the dénouement, which seems to just end.I've barely left myself room to talk about the good points. The first\none, which most people mention, is the acting. There isn't a bad\nperformance in the film, but Pacino, De Niro, and some relatively minor\ncharacters, like those played by Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John\nCazale, really stand out.The second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the\nbeautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production\ndesign is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit\nscenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness,\nand everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange.\nAmazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly\ndifficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I can't\nremember another film since that has been able to capture the same\nlook. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors,\ncreating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.Although the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus\non most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. Given that,\nand the film's importance culturally, The Godfather Part II is a\nmust-see.\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071562/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0,

to this point, if there is one thing I despise it would have to be sequels. Now, for those that are new, the reason why is simple: sequels next to never live up to their potential and end up destroying the story that the original had created. Well, this film does not destroy nor surpasses The Godfather. Instead, it is more like a continuation of an already great tale, giving us the back story on Vito (played by a then unknown RObert De Niro) and the destruction of Michael (played by already Academy Award winner Al Pacino) in a rather original way to tell both stories: show through out the film both sides as they happen at once. Now, as most people know, I love the beloved original film and I was a little worried about my taste with this film. I already knew that it won a slew of Academy Awards (including the award for best film; a first for a sequel) and people have had the audacity to say that this is the better film in Francis Ford Coppola's epic Crime saga. My opinion after watching this film is that, if I had to guess where it would rank among the three films, I would have to say that it would be almost tied to the original. The main reason is this: The original had a feel of being welcomed into this world. Through the opening shots of Vito Corleone talking to his friend on the day of his daughter's wedding, we are welcomed with cold arms into their world. With this film however, you are just thrown in without any mercy. You are shown the blunt world where everyone is guilty of something and no one is innocent (except the children Marianna Hill as Deanna Corleone) and you are left cold and isolated as you look into the past and present of the Corleone crime family. But what really makes this film stand out would have to be how much all of the characters have changed from the previous film. For Michael, he goes from being a bright young man to a ruthless, heartless, cold bastard that destroys everything in his way to his sister Connie who has become something of a complete tramp and a neglectful mother. Due to how these characters change, you get the feeling that this film would be better due to their development. But, as I have said, it is mostly due to the feel of this film that makes the original a tad bit better. But, ignoring that aspect, this film is a perfect follow up to the original classic. Now for the details. With directing, Coppola shows us that he is no where near tired yet as he directs this entire masterpiece. Now, the thing that caught me off guard with this film would have to be the slew of emotions I felt while watching this film. If there is one thing that Coppola can do is make his audience feel for the characters. He allows them to build up, grow,  and when two particular scenes near the end begin, you can not help but feel like you are about to burst into tears due to how desperate one character is, and the actions and heartache another one shows us. Coppola is a master behind a camera, and this film might be his directorial masterpiece (next to The Godfather and Apocalypse Now). With acting, oh wow. Where do I begin with this one. Might as well start with the men of this film. Okay, first person to mention is Al Pacino in his award winning role as Michael Corelone. After already winning an Academy Award for that role when he was in the original, I am still impressed at how he was able to move the character through out this story. He made the character barbaric, evil, and just plain unlikable, but his acting made him likable as well. Just, Pacino breathed life into this character and allowed him to take control in so many ways it was unreal. After this film was made, he won another Academy Award for this film and I must say: it was well earned. Next is Robert De Niro portraying Vito Corleone. As most people know about this film, it goes back and forth between Michael's life and Vito's life and for Vito, we have a then unknown actor filling in the shoes of Marlon Brando. Now, that alone is difficult as hell to do, considering how great Brando was and how iconic he made the character. Now, my reaction to this performance was that I am impressed with the bravery alone that De Niro had for this performance. He portrayed the younger Vito with such power and authority that he would of made Brando proud. He was just that good. Now, De Niro would go on the receive the Academy Award for Best Supporting actor, and for this film he deserves it. If you are a fan of De Niro's work, then this is a good place to start for learning about his career. Now you have Robert Duvall as the ever loyal Tom Hagen. Personally, I like how he was able to keep cool during some rather intense scenes that deal with Michael's decent into pure hell. Duvall gives it his all in this film and he was wonderful. Now we must get down to the three women who took over this film. The first would have to be Diane Keaton as Amy Corleone. When we last saw her, we saw the look of shame and disgust that was on her face when she realized how much Michael has lied to her. In this film, she wants out. How badly does she want to get out? So bad that she does the unthinkable in one scene and makes it out to be something different that is all part of her plan. Now, Keaton had to play a complete different character in this film and seeing her new way of handling this character, I will admit that it was shocking and reveling in terms of her pure talent to act. She is an incredible actress and she is wonderful. Next would have to be Marianna Hill as Deanna Corleone. In the first film, Marianna had very little screen time as she was not that important to the story. Here, she plays a much larger role and has one of the most somber scenes in this film. She makes the character out to be more then a sweet old lady, she makes the character out to be an intelligent, thoughtful, and wise person who helps Michael when he is left with a terrible thought that nearly destroys him. Lastly Talia Shire as Connie. Like most females in the first film, here she shines as a totally different character. What makes her worthy is how she makes herself out to be this tramp that just does not care about her family, hates her brother, and abandons her children. Connie transformed in one of the worst ways possible, but we love Shire for making the character so damn wonderful to watch. Next up is the script. One thing that needs to be stressed is that this film's script was only half written from the original novel by Mario Puzo. The other half was written by him and Coppola, but it was mostly original. Personally, I did not think that the story needed to be continued, but having the original creator there to do the work, the script became a clever, emotionally charged epic that is bound to catch a few people off guard. Fantastic work here. Lastly the score. Getting Nina Rota back again, the score is longer, has more music cues, and is just fun to listen to. The best tracks appear during the flashback scenes in the film while the msot dramatic happen in the present day parts. But, what I like about it is just how creative it gets with the music and how it moves from the beginning to the end. The entire time, we are eclipsed with the wonders of it's notes that the music becomes a comfort in so many scenes. Then again, the score did win the award for best original score, so that should say something. Overall, this is an emotional film that is worthy of it's original and works well as a stand alone in some respects.", :title=>nil, :location=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"rotten_tomatoes",

It was considered a masterpiece and the story was amazing. Along with a great cast, the movie never seemed too long for its 3 hour run time.\r\rIn 1974, the sequel was revealed . . . \r\rThe Godfather Part II is known as the greatest sequel made in film making history. 200 minute (3 hours and 20 minutes) run time and a dark story filled the movie theaters. We all knew when the famous score from the first movie came on, we were in for a treat . . . and it was amazing.\r\rThe Godfather Part II switches between present time with Michael Corleone (Al Pacino in a riveting performance) taking control of the gambling in the country and young Vito Corleone's (Robert DeNiro, spot on) climb to power in New York's Lower East Side. But first Michael:\r\rMichael Corleone has moved to Nevada where he begins to take over all the gambling in the country. As his son's, Anthony, communion party he is confronted by a Senator where Michael is insulted and forced to buy the gambling license for $250,000. But Michael keeps his cool and respectfully says, \"Senator? You can have my answer now, if you like. My final offer is this: nothing. Not even the fee for the gaming license, which I would appreciate if you would put up personally.\" - right there we realize that Michael means business and prepare for a lot of it. That night, his bedroom is sprayed over with bullets as Michael crawls over to the other side of the bed to protect Kay (Diane Keaton) and her baby. This is where we find out that this movie is going to be one hell of a ride. Michael believes it could be Frank Pentangeli, a loud mouth who feels mistreated by Michael, or Hyman Roth, a sick but powerful man who controls the gambling in Miami.\r\rBut this is only half of the story . . .\r\rThe other half follows young Vito as he suffers through the murders of his father, brother Paolo and mother by the Don in Corleone. We watch him secretly taken to a boat to travel to the United States through Elis Island. There we watch him grow from a worker at a local Italian Deli to a powerful man in New York City. How he gets there is the most important part. While he is a business man in most of the scenes he isn't scared to get his hands dirty sometimes. In the end, he returns to Italy for one that \"chore\" to finish up.\r\rThese two stories (while the movie mainly follows Michael's empire) juxtapose each other. On one side, the movie shows Vito climb to power as a business man and helpful to his neighborhood, but on the other, the movie shows Michael's descent into Hell so-to-speak. Unlike his father, who even says, \"We are not murderers\", Michael isn't afraid to wipe people out during his time as \"Don\" of his empire. As Michael says to Tom, \"Tom, you know you surprise me. If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone.\" This is one of many quotes that Michael shouts out in the movie. The movie shines in the shadows of Michael's dark mind. After you have seen the movie, you have no idea which things Michael said were actually true. The truth is very hard to find in this film and that is one of its many fantastic characteristics.\r\rThe film also comes with its fair share of shocks. Without spitting anything out, this movie will shock you in at least three scenes - all of which are memorable. One scene in particular with Kay and Michael is full of anger and shock that many will feel uncomfortable watching based on it's dialogue. The dialogue in this film is tremendous - probably better than the first film. You have the famous quote, \"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse\" in the movie but many others, one of which I have written in the paragraph above. Others are just brilliantly made. Each sentence of dialogue supports or creates the dark scenes within this film.\r\rThe cast in the movie is outstanding yet again. Al Pacino is excellent as Michael Corleone. He was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role in 1974 and didn't win. (NOTE: If there is one performance that Al Pacino should have won for, it has to be this film. He is amazing!). Diane Keaton is great as Michael's pregnant wife, Robert Duvall as Tom Harper is outstanding as usual, and Robert DeNiro as Vito Corleone is tremendous as he won Best Supporting Actor for this role.\r\rSay what you want about the first film whether it is a classic or its a masterpiece but let this be certain: The Godfather Part II might be better. In my opinion, not only is it the greatest sequel ever made, but it is even better than Part I. The violence is intenser, the story is darker, the performances are more riveting than Part I, and the run time is longer. The Godfather Part II is Best Picture of 1974 and once again it is well deserved.\r\rThis is Michael Corleone's descent into Hell throughout the movie. He becomes a monster and if you look back at how Michael actually got to this point, you will be amazed on how he has changed. The movie ends with Michael thinking back to when he told his family that he enlisted in the Marines and how upset they were. It begins with Michael in his father's chair but not following his father's footsteps. If you watch this movie for the first time I want you to picture the first time you meet Michael in Part I - then press play. At the end, you should see a drastic change as if Michael is two people.\r\rIf there is anything that Michael will try to teach you as you watch this amazing film it is this, \"There are many things my father taught me here in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.\"", :title=>nil, :location=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"rotten_tomatoes", :url=>"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/godfather_part_ii"},

MAYBE THE BEST OF THINGS. AND NO GOOD THING EVER DIES\" Casting was spotty, with Tim Robbins a great choice for the lead character, Dufresne. Robbins maintains viewer interest anytime he is the focus of attention, unfortunately a lot of the screen time is devoted to the narrator, “Red,” (Morgan Freeman) who drops pearls of cracker barrel wisdom a la Waylon Jennings’ narration of The Dukes of Hazzard. Morgan Freeman, while a decent enough actor in no way can stimulate my interest for very long with his bland, long-winded, homespun observations on the Dufresne character and prison life in general. I feel that Freeman’s performance was not strong enough to carry the amount of screen time assigned by the director. Bob Gunton, as Warden Norton the bible thumping hypocrite who runs Shawshank is a great asset to the film with his sly characterization of the unlikable tyrant.

There are plenty of anti-heroes in good films, like \"Leon\" for example. Or, The Professional if you will. The film was originally titled Leon in France but then changed to The Professional when it came over to America. I guess because they figured that American audiences wouldn't be interested in seeing a movie titled Leon, they'd just miss out on what the film was really about.I think the difference in something like \"Leon\" is that while he's an assassin for hire, he's only going out and killing other drug dealers and corrupt cops and people who are as vile or worse. There's a code he follows. So it's like the lesser of two evils, you can relate with him because he's better then the people he combats. Same with Batman, he's a vigilante and thus a criminal, but he follows a code and commits violence against those even worse then he is. While in Shawshank... the convicts are imprisoned for committing crimes against innocent people, we assume. We don't really find out the specific circumstances, but it's generally understood that these people were not committing crimes against even worse human beings.So this aura of reverence and love for the film has always mystified me. I'm not going to say it's a bad film. The cinematography and acting all seem fairly competent. But it just didn't do anything for me. I felt bored by it. And ya know, listening to people hyping it up to be one of the greatest films ever made didn't help either. It's number one on IMDB's top 250 greatest, for God's sake.

AndyPerhaps it can be frowned upon to view a prison drama in such high regard, it may indeed paint a false picture of real life situations, but at the end of the day, the entertainment value and lasting effect of The Shawshank Redemption, a truly emotional discovery and, well, redemption. Everything aside, the film is simply about a friendship under the most unorthodox of circumstances. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is locked up in Shawshank prison in 1947, being convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is initially given a hard time as being the new guy, but his generally laid back attitude catch the attention of Red (Morgan Freeman). As Andy and Red get to know each other, Red soon realises that perhaps there is more than meets the eye with his new acquaintance, as Andy slowly begins to change the lives of the people closest to him. Unfortunately as time goes on, Andy's impatience starts with his life inside starts to show, he seems more reckless and outspoken, regardless of how he has made small but significant changes to the prison itself and of course its inmates. We are left to watch Andy's journey through the wonderful narration of Morgan Freeman's Red, who is constantly but pleasantly surprised at Andy's personality and reactions to his surroundings. The true friendship lies where these two are completely different, Red has made peace with his situation, accepting his fate and serving life, but Andy is determined to \"Get busy living\". Tim Robbins perfectly portrays a character who is purposely isolated from everyone, he can very much take care of himself and show is intelligence and cunning nature at many shining moments in this remarkable film. Morgan Freeman is very much the good guy who followed the wrong path, he gets on with almost everyone who is worth getting on with and doesn't cause trouble, apart from being the \"go to' guy in the prison. The word perfect could indeed give the justice this movie deserves. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is powerful and absorbing, he is always trying to make you become part of the walls that these prisoners call home, his various shots including a few prisoners sitting on top of the roof in the early morning drinking beer and another when Andy manages to play Mozart through the tannoy system speaks waves to the capabilities not necessarily by the actors, but to the scenery that they are surrounded by, and it is truly breathtaking. It's just a show that is too good to miss, it emerged out of nowhere and really hit home on an emotional level, there is no action in it, simply life lessons that need to be heard, each character has a vibrant role to play that will make us concerning of their situations, and Frank Darabont has created a perfectly diverse cast to blend in with this masterful and commanding film.", :useful=>[0.0, 0], :username=>"StevenF", :date=>"Apr 13, 2013", :location=>nil, :title=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"metacritic", :url=>"http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-shawshank-redemption"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"Perhaps it can be frowned upon to view a prison drama in such high regard, it may indeed paint a false picture of real life situations, but at the end of the day, the entertainment value and lasting effect of The Shawshank Redemption, a truly emotional discovery and, well, redemption.

It's too slow. The Shawshank Redemption may be a tad slow, but it is justified. I believe director Frank Darabont wanted to show Andy's time at Shawshank by showing how slow prison time really is. Some movies are just slow; this movie does it for a deeper reason, adding to Shawshank's genius. 2. Andy Dufresne barely shows emotion. Those people obviously didn't get what kind of character Andy was. Tim Robbins did this on purpose. Andy was quiet, mellow, and was obviously quite shocked and angry he was going to prison for a crime he didn't do. Did you really expect the man to jump up and start singing \"Kumbaya\"? No! So I don't get what the problem is. The fact that he acted like this just added to the realistic atmosphere of the movie. 3. This is not realistic. Oh yes your right, since these men in prison smoked, cursed, drank, and kept their eyes peeled in the shower room for potential rapists. That is not realistic at all. (sarcastic) Overall, I think some of the hate on Shawshank is solely because it is the highest rated movie on IMDb, for a fact. (User rating is 9.3 to this date). I think some people hate this movie because everyone else loves it, and that is a bad way to think about anything, not just movies.

moves anyone who watches it. This movie is grand in scope and scale, its character portrayals so moving and so real, that you cannot help becoming completely engrossed by it. I believe that the Shawshank Redemption is one of these movies. Often times, movies based on books are sub par, with the common complaint being, \"The book is better.\" Well I, for one, have read the book and watched the movie, and I assure you that the movie is not a let down at all, but rather a triumph of modern cinema. The DVD disc itself is a little thin on features, but at an average price of about $15, anyone with a DVD player and a taste for Drama(or anyone who simply likes excellent movies) should own this movie on DVD.  Now, on to the movie itself. The Shawshank Redemption saw career-defining performances from many of its cast members,including Tim Robbins, who became a top star after his incredible performance, and Morgan Freeman, who added to his already impressive list of accolades with his perfect supporting role. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a Maine banker who is unjustly convicted of killing his wife and her lover after he discovers that she is having an affair. Andy is a true outsider in the bleak world of Shawshank prison, an educated man not used to violence and despair that are an everyday part of prison life. Robbins plays this part to perfection, showing emotional vulnerability, as well as the stregnth to overcome the greatest adversity. Freeman plays Red, \"The man who can get it all,\" a prisoner serving a life sentence for murder, who befriends Andy. Red adapts to his life in prison by becoming a source for bringing outside goods to prisoners.  The interplay between Robbins and Freeman is one of the highlights of the movie, as these two wonderful actors test each other's limits. James Whitmore plays Brooks Hatlin, a man who spends his entire life in Shawshank as a librarian. Once released,as an old man, Brooks finds that he would rather die that live another day in a unfamiliar world. His character is a tragic example of how the human mind can become so attached to its circumstances(even the blak setting of a prison) that it simply cannot let go of them. Bob Gunton takes a memorable turn as Bible-quoting Warden Samuel Norton, whose facade of morality is merely a mask for his depraved behavior and illegal activites.  Frank Darabont, who wrote the screenplay and directed this movie,is a master of skilfully portraying human emotions. He deserves all the credit he gets for helping to shape this memorable movie experience. Stepen King's brilliance shines through, as his ability to create complex and memorable characters is evident in this movie.  The bottom line is this: The Shawshank Redemption is a monumental achievement in motion picture history. It is defined by a memorable story, engrossing character performances, and one of the most truly gratifying endings I have ever seen in a movie.

A movie so elegant and  emotional that is perfect in its way of storytelling. A movie that is about  how hope can never die. The movie earned several Academy Award nominations  that were certainly well-deserved, but it left theaters all too quickly.  Over the years though, it has gained a strong cult following.The movie  stars Tim Robbins in one of his very best performances as Andrew Dufresne,  a quiet man who is convicted of the murder of his wife and is sent to  Shawshank prison. It's there he meets \"Red\", a convict played by  Morgan Freeman who gets things from the outside for a price. He first sees  Andy as he's lead into the prison and predicts that he won't last long  inside the prison walls. Over time though, he's suprised that the young man  is able to survive and soon, the two become friends with respect for each  other. Andy is not a man who \"fights the system\". He spends his  days in his own quiet world, a courage that the other prisoners don't quite  understand at first. Robbins has built this character in a way that we  the performance is not showy, but subtle. The result is that we want to  know more and when we do begin to understand his ways, that only makes us  want him to succeed that much more. I won't go into much more in the way of  detail about the movie; if you haven't seen it, I don't want to ruin any of  the enjoyment of the movie; if you have, I'm sure you already have your  feelings about the movie. This is a movie that's not depressing; it has a  lot of life to it and I think that when they look back at the 90's, they  will see that this is one of the best pictures that was released during  this time.Yes, Warner Brothers has proven to made an error in judgement  about their way of going about putting this DVD out. There was an  announcement over a year ago, I believe; then previous announcements came  later after the first delay promising a director's commentary, then a  Morgan Freeman commentary, then, in the final moments before the DVD is  released this week...nothing. It's a shame, as \"Shawshank\" is a  film deserving of much more. I suppose part of me is happy with the fact  that this film is finally on DVD, although if this is the final product,  there is no reason in my mind that this couldn't have been released a long,  is an excellent looking image. One of the best cinematographers in the  business (Roger Deakins- \"Fargo\") did the filming on this picture  and the pale colors are represented well throughout the picture, mainly  browns and greys. Like the movie, there is an elegance to the visual style  on this picture that is apparent in every movie that Deakins has worked on.  Images are clear and crisp throughout; sharp, but not overly sharp for a  \"smooth\" feeling that looks very film-like.There are few  problems, and none of them are terribly distracting at all. There is a  slight shimmering in a scene or two and some very small instances of grain.  Other than that, this is an excellent looking image that will certainly  beautiful sound mix. It's also a newly remastered 5.1 mix. It's not flashy  or showy, nor does it need to be. It does however, do what it needs to do  best very well. The score by Thomas Newman is absolutely wonderful and it  sounds clear and crisp throughout the picture. Surrounds are put into use  occasionally, but always in a subtle way that is right for the picture.  What I was pleased about most though, was how rich and clean the score  sounded on this DVD. Dialogue is clear and without problems as well. Again,  Non-animated main menus that have the score playing in the  dissapointment of this DVD; all that's included is the trailer and some  production  stills.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Final  Thoughts Although it's unfortunate that this isn't the special edition that  it should have been it is a must for any collection.

Why only four stars then? Because we are asked to rate the DVD, not the movie, and the criminal lack of DVD extras for one of the best films ever made is shameful. So, film five stars, DVD three - averaging out at 4. Maths lesson over, on with the review.  Based on the Stephen King novella ' Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption ' this really has become a modern day classic. Other films have grossed more, and may have a more immediate following, but Shawshank will endure for years, and become another 'Casablanca ' loved by generations to come.  The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, sent to the maximum security prison of Shawshank for the murder of his wife and her lover. Played with an under-stated intelligence by Tim Robbins in a career defining turn, and supported by sterling performances from Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, and veteran James Whitmore. Morgan Freeman's work is particularly notable, not just for his performance ( let's face it, the man doesn't know how to give a bad one! ) but also for the fact that his is the voice of the film. His chocolate-rich tones were director Frank Darabont's choice for the voice-over of the film, as if his character Red is talking to us, and explaining the sub-text of the film. Voice overs often dont work ( Blade Runner being a prime example ) but this one does, perfectly.  Beginning at a slow pace, the film begins with the brutal de-humanising regime meted out to the 'Fresh Fish' as they begin their incarcaration in Shawshank. I remember suggesting my wife watch the film after I'd seen it, and she, being of a considerably more sensitive nature than me, found the early scenes difficult. If you too find the opening 45 minutes a tad heavy going, stick with it - the reward is worth it.  Eventually as we progress through the film, we see how Red's initial suspicion of Andy becomes a deep respect, and eventually a deep friendship, indeed it would be true to say that these two men love each other like brothers by the end. There are a few key scenes that really stick in the memory - the rooftop scene, the opera aria scene, the exam result scene - all of which enable us to begin to like these men, men we probably wouldn't have wanted in our homes before the film, but who we'd happily sit down to dinner with after.  The film's true emotional impact of course comes in the final third as we learn the truth about Andy's guilt or otherwise. True to many of King's works, there is a twist in the end which leaves us all stunned, and with a big stupid grin on our faces. The total and utter defeat of the dark forces in the film is accomplished with such applomb that you find yourself rooting for the bad guys  - the prisoners, a bunch of murderers and misfits that two hours earlier you were deeply suspicious of. Indeed the last section of the film plays almost totally without our hero, and remains almost my favourite portion of it. By this time we are crying out for the final fulfilment of our hopes for the characters. It is to Frank Darabont's eternal credit that he accomplishes this in a scene without dialogue, and a sweeping panoramic withdrawl from the characters, leaving us with not a dry eye in the house, and a feel-good glow that lasts for days. ... while in [a local store] I noticed this man and wife trying to decide which DVD they would buy to view that evening. I pointed to Shawshank. \"Ever seen this one?\"\"No\"\"Trust me\" I said, \"It's the best movie you've never seen.\" He bought it, and I like to think I made that man and wife cry, laugh and smile that evening.  To conclude, Warner Bros and Castle Rock - SHAME ON YOU! This movie deserves better. The Region 2 version rocks, so get busy, re-package, and give us fans the extras this classic deserves!P.S. The ten-year anniversary edition has righted many wrongs. The film has finally been done justice. I watched it again the other night, and again my eyes welled up at the end.

Whether it was the lack of a catchy title, or the rather bland movie poster showing Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the true spirit of this film never got the attention it deserved at it's big-screen opening.  For this, I'm guilty, too.  I showed no interest in it when it opened.  Never have I been so wrong in judging a movie.  The motion picture awards institutions were wrong in not properly recognizing this film as possibly the greatest of all time.  I never expected a prison film to be my all-time favorite.It was two precious years before my brother convinced me to see it.  I must say, no film has ever driven me to tears like this one did.  It is a compelling story of the strength of human character, emerging from the most hopeless of situations.  As it turns out, hope is exactly what empowers the prisoners of Shawshank.(Spoiler ahead!) The cinematography and musical score are magical, especially in the scene where Red is dropped off in Buxton to search the fields for Andy's stash, and where he finally reunites with Andy in Mexico.  It just streams with emotion.  The script: superbly written.  All this was put together by a talented director who can go to his grave knowing he orchestrated one of the finest films in history.

Walker", :location=>"from Paducah, KY", :date=>"27 August 2002", :content=>"\n\nCan Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only,\ncreate art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach\nit\nin a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a\ndaunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable\nmanagerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of\nart in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting.\nThese elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet\nstill form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of\nthe artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for\nhis\nnotable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his\nfeature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself\nalready a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most\nrecognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The\nShawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the\nemotions,\nand brings an era of artistically influential films back to\nHollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense,\nvictimized\nby circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his\nwife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a\nlife sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in\nthis prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls\naround him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from\nhis fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly\nreferred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within\nthe drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare\nto\nthe confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope\ncauses\nRed to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy\nproves\nto Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank\nprison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled\nscreenplay\npaved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with\nthe phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella,\nRita\nHayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that\nhe can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous\npiece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many\nways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas\nwhere the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film\ntransitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella,\nDarabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of\nemotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the\ncunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred\nNewman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing\nNewman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as\nif a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism\nand tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score\ncomposition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score\nreceived an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent,\nNewman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from\nthe film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers,\ncomposers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast\nof The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The\nmarvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most\nconvincing\nperformances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan\nFreeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting\nlies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear\ninto their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James\nWhitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man\nincarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself\nattached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these\nactors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their\nmotivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to\nanything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the\nmost beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as\nits focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope\nand\nfreedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly\nyearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws\nits\naudience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart\nwill go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions,\nand deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a\ngreat\nnovel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply\nentertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully,\nillustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us\na\npoignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we\nall seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it\nlong lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability.

Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and\nPulp Fiction were \"just happy to be nominated.\" Of course hindsight is\n20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and\nRedemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however,\nwas a success from the word \"go,\" making a huge splash at Cannes and\nmaking its writer-director an American master after only two films. For\nAndy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure\nwasn't a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell\nfast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for\nfailure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans\ntoday, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was.\nOn the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on\n\"that 'Rickshaw' movie.\" Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as\n'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between\ntwo best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie\nis slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post,\n\"it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance\nof narrative exit points before settling on its finale.\" But it is\nthese same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a\ntotal eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and\nGothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts\nits shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above\nevery shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all\nmemories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope.\nIt's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; \"In here's\nwhere you need it most,\" he says. \"You need it so you don't forget.\nForget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of\nstone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's\nyours, that they can't touch.\" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much\nof Andy at first, picking \"that tall glass o' milk with the silver\nspoon up his ass\" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word,\nand losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two\nget to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This\nagain, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about\nlove, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the\nonly one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two\nbest friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship\ntime and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's\nday to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional,\nbut Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film\nis much better for it.It's pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the\nsame actors, it is easy to forget that the movie's timeline spans well\nover 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in\nreality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it's not as if the\nfilm lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it's going,\nit merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off\nas well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more\nexhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be\nforgotten.With themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to\nbe found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ\nfigure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard\nNixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they\ncome. But if you aren't looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to\nanyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving\nfilm, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don't come much\nbetter than this.OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message\nof hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved\nthere is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran\nsolely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of\n1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally\nswapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time --\nredemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you\nwaiting for? As Andy says, \"It comes down a simple choice, really.\nEither get busy living, or get busy dying.\"\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/"},

It's a poignant story\nabout hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a\nmovie. It tells a lesson about life.\nThose are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's\nalso a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, \nfrom rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are\nmajestic in their performances. Each learns from the other.\nTheir relationship is strong and you feel that from the first\nmoment they make contact with one another.

In addition to its Oscar nominations and huge critical acclaim, the film has topped the IMDb Top 250 for years and shows no signs of dropping off any time soon. Any attempt to criticise it could come across as churlish or contrarian, the work of someone attempting to be above what is popular for their own self-righteous sake. Fortunately, there is little need to criticise - for Shawshank really is as great as people make it out to be.It's easy to forget how much of a slow-burning success Shawshank was. Despite favourable reviews and its many nominations, the film barely broke even on first release. It was only with the VHS release that word began to spread like wildfire, so that by the turn of the century it had garnered a reputation as a modern American great. In an age where films are dead in the water if they don't perform on opening weekend, it is hard to imagine a situation in which another Shawshank could emerge (although Slumdog Millionaire is a reasonable candidate).It's equally easy to forget how brutal the film is, particularly in its first 20 minutes. Shawshank's reputation as a popular favourite might lead the uninitiated to thinking that it's an uplifting, feel-good film - and it is true that these later moments are the ones which have most entered into popular consciousness. But any film about hope needs a source of despair to provide conflict, and Shawshank has more than enough violence and emotional trauma to justify its 15 certificate. As Mark Kermode famously remarked, there's a whole lot of Shawshank before the Redemption.Even without its reputation, Shawshank is one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work. Indeed, among King's dramatic stories, it is outshone only by its successor The Green Mile. Frank Darabont has a greater understanding of King than almost any other filmmaker: he gets the tone spot on and recreates the period setting brilliantly with the help of Roger Deakins' cinematography. Despite the much-parodied narration that punctuates the film, the drama unfolds naturally and believably throughout, with the characters always being at the forefront and naked exposition being kept to a bare minimum.Shawshank is a good example of how adaptation works - or more specifically, how changes made to the original story in translation often benefit the finished product. The best example of this is the character of Red, who in the original novel is a red-headed Irishman. This is referred to jokingly by Morgan Freeman in one of his first conversations with Tim Robbins; when Andy asks why people call him Red, Red responds: \"Maybe it's because I'm Irish.\".On top of Freeman's obvious ability, the casting decision makes sense because it adds an extra layer of meaning to the character. Red is one of the few black characters we come across; while he applies himself in different ways, he is as much of an outsider as Andy DuFresne. This is borne out by his remarks about institutionalisation, which are laughed off by his fellow inmates. Red may be well-connected when it comes to smuggling things in, but otherwise he is just as lonely as Andy.Shawshank approaches the theme of institutionalisation with great grace and dexterity. Because the story takes place over three decades, the temptation would be to canter through the plot points and cut straight to Andy's escape - you could even stage the entire story in flashback. Instead, Darabont allows the film to unfold at a gentle, gradual pace, reflecting the mind-set of the characters. They don't realise how trapped they are until it's too late, just as we don't realise that two-and-a-half hours has passed until the credits have begun to roll.The characters reflect the different extents and effects of institutionalisation. Brooks has built his entire identity around his books and role in the prison; he is so afraid of this being taken away that he attempts to kill William Sadler's character so he can stay inside. Red is aware of how trapped he is, and shares Brooks' fears, being unsure that he could get things for Andy on the outside. But at the same time, he refuses to let himself be vulnerable, trying to play the system and constantly getting turned down for parole. Andy allows himself to be vulnerable and endures all the pain that it brings him, sustained by the knowledge of his innocence and the hope that he will escape.Shawshank is perhaps the most powerful depiction of hope in all of cinema. The original short story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, was subtitled 'Hope Springs Eternal'. The film returns to hope and the celebration of the human spirit like a leitmotif, and succeeds because it retains Andy's humanity in all its many shades. While he is very different to the other prisoners, he is never presented as a saint or goody-goody, smiling gormlessly in the face of maddening torment. This makes his endurance all the more powerful: we recognise our faults in his moments of weakness, and aspire to his inner moral strength.The film has attracted many Christian interpretations - in fact, in my review of John Carpenter's The Thing, I called it \"a poster child for Christianity\". It's not hard to see why, considering its celebration of inner strength and devotion, and its overall arc of good triumph over evil against the greatest odds. While Andy has been called a Christ figure, he's just as close to the character of Daniel in the Old Testament: he finds himself in a strange land against his will, and in order to survive he applies his natural talents to the service of his temporal masters. Through his labours the people around him benefit and the system is eventually changed for the better - albeit through pain, suffering and several deaths.An equally intriguing interpretation comes from Mark Kermode, who authored a BFI Modern Classic on the film in 2003. In a video discussing cinematic depictions of Richard Nixon, Kermode made the argument that Warden Norton (played brilliantly by Bob Gunton) is an allegory for Nixon, with Andy's prison term matching Nixon's political career. Norton begins reaching out for friendship (Nixon seeking to be elected), then becomes the corrupt leader (beginning in the year that Kennedy was shot), and finally descends into paranoia and disgrace, culminating in a more literal suicide than Nixon offered us.Whether you believe these interpretations or not, Shawshank is a terrific piece of dramatic film-making which soars on the strengths of its main performers. Tim Robbins perfectly captures Andy's distant, ethereal quality while retaining his wry and infectious sense of humour. Morgan Freeman's performance may well be responsible for his subsequent type-casting, but he matches Robbins beat for beat, offsetting hope with world-weariness and guilt. There's also great support from two actors who would subsequently work with Darabont again - William Sadler (who appears in The Green Mile) and James Whitmore (The Majestic).The only fly in the ointment with Shawshank is its ending. The film is about hope as a value in and of itself, emphasising the importance of having it even if it is not rewarded. Red's transition to embracing hope is far more important than his reunion with Andy, and this reunion shifts the film's message from celebrating hope to justifying the characters' pain on the basis of a happy ending. It's also clear that this ending was put together at the last minute, with subtle shifts in the cinematography and a far more rushed pacing to it.The Shawshank Redemption may not be entirely worthy of its number one ranking on IMDb, but it remains a really terrific piece of drama let down only by its final scene. In every other aspect it's a masterpiece, as a character piece, a treatise on hope and a beautifully paced and mounted Stephen King adaptation. It remains a must-see for all film fans of penchant or persuasion, earning its status as a modern classic and securing a warm place in our hearts.", :title=>nil, :location=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"rotten_tomatoes", :url=>"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shawshank_redemption"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"Before we can critically assess The Shawshank Redemption, we first have to deal with The Shawshank Reputation.", :clean_text=>"before we can critically assess the shawshank redemption we first have to deal with the shawshank reputation.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"In addition to its Oscar nominations and huge critical acclaim, the film has topped the IMDb Top 250 for years and shows no signs of dropping off any time soon.", :clean_text=>"in addition to its oscar nominations and huge critical acclaim the film has topped the imdb top 250 for years and shows no signs of dropping off any time soon.", :sentiment=>1, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>2, :text=>"Any attempt to criticise it could come across as churlish or contrarian, the work of someone attempting to be above what is popular for their own self-righteous sake.", :clean_text=>"any attempt to criticise it could come across as churlish or contrarian the work of someone attempting to be above what is popular for their own self-righteous sake.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>3, :text=>"Fortunately, there is little need to criticise -

At best, it is a searing depiction of the corruption that sometimes goes on at the highest rankings (a disturbing turn from Bob Gunton as Warden Norton), as well as the ugliness that engulfs prison life. This is not a perfect movie, notably because it contains a useless section involving Robbins educating a troubled inmate, for the sole sake of showing just how corrupt the Warden is (but we already know he is, the story does not need to hammer it down anymore).

Tolkien. It blends seamlessly with the Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers to create the journey and story that , and yet stands on its own as a masterpiece, a masterful piece of cinema that will endure till the end of days. Its visual grandeur, cinematographic excellence, musical dexterity, haunting narrative, and ultimate perfection coalesce to create a tale, unlimited in emotional richness, that will resonate through the ages. Every viewing of the film for me is a journey in and of itself, one that ultimately ends in tears (I hear Gandalf lamenting right now \"I will not say do not weep, for not all tears are an evil\"). I fondly recall the midnight premiere of film and how, when I looked around at the audience during the Grey Havens scene, there was not a dry eye in the house, including my father who has (forgive me for the clicheness ) the emotional range of a teaspoon. If that isn't evidence for the profound emotionality of the film, then I don't know what is.

Apart from the international cast, the people who were actually working to bring us the trilogy, like special effects, were Kiwis. The majority of this credit must go to Jackson for his leadership and vision, and for succeeding in hiring an able team. The Return of the King is the concluding chapter in the trilogy. The story is picked up where it was left off at the end of The Two Towers. We are shown a glimpse into Gollum's past. The rest of the fellowship reunite at Isengard. Saruman's fate is omitted from the theatrical edition, which I always found odd given his importance in the previous instalment. It is a time for festivities in Rohan in the wake of the victory at Helm's Deep. An accident shows us Sauron's plans for Minas Tirith, the legendary capital of Gondor. The fellowship breaks again in a different way. Gandalf rides to the city to find the steward reluctant to lift even a finger for its defence. Needless to say, things work out and Rohirrim ride for Gondor's aid. Faramir, dejected by his father, rides out in a last ditched effort to reclaim Osgiliath. A family heirloom is returned to Aragorn which he uses to find help in the most unexpected places. Another plot device if you ask me. If you keep an eye out for them, they become very obvious. Jackson could have lessened its impact or omitted it entirely, making sure the battle was won through the prowess of battle commanders, which he failed to do so. As Fellowship never purported to show us a huge battle at all, and did not have to resolve it, I will forever hold it in higher regard than Return. The Two Towers resolved its battle much more satisfactorily, but Return has got much more on the former in other areas, so the second place goes to the latter. Orcs begin the attack on the city. Gandalf leads the defence. The battle looks grander than the one at Helm's Deep, the besieging armies and weapons more awe-inspiring. The special effects used to bring this conflict to life were stunning_ showing the destruction of architecture by the catapults and the loss of men and Orcs; as well as bringing to life Shelob, the giant spider. The scene of the Rohirrim cutting through the Orcs on their horses is possibly the most spectacular. Oliphaunts and Nazguls join the fight. My previous apathy for Eowyn is cured after watching the extended version, in which she develops significantly. In fact, she is the only female character in Middle Earth who is of some worth, and I like where her story took us, climaxing in a very satisfactory way in the middle of a battle, pitted against only the most important antagonists. The main trio_ Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, are absent from much of the fighting, as the other two accompany the former on his journey of self-discovery. I was earnestly hoping for them to join the fight, which they did (Legolas displaying some very impressive killer moves), but it was so ridiculously short. Four minutes. Believe me, I counted. In this regard The Two Towers was much better, as well as having more memorable scenes with the Gollum. Frodo's inevitable clash with Gollum goes full circle. Sam displays unprecedented strength of character and resolve, and the Hobbits thrive without much help from men. Men ride once more to aid Frodo in his quest to rid them of the ring, and a final battle sequence follows, after which it is destroyed. In epilogue, we learn about the fates of the Hobbits, Aragorn and Gandalf. The extended edition had some interesting scenes which enriched the characters and the story, but also some which betrayed some ineptitude at editing. One scene had a character utter the exact same dialogue to persuade someone in the span of a single conversation. Surely a rewording would have been more effective. I scoffed at a particular attempt to blossom an affair between two secondary characters. Such things should have been hinted at in the epilogue. No one is interested in that stuff when the stakes involve the end of the world. Finally, a discussion about the extraordinary tally at the Oscars. Eleven well-deserved wins out of as many nominations, in fields as diverse as art direction, costume design, make-up, sound, original score, original song, editing, visual effects, adapted screenplay, directing, and Best Picture. In the end I would observe that the extended editions of the first and second instalments, three hours twenty and three hours thirty-three minutes respectively, enhanced the tales while the third one, a crushing four hours, did not achieve anything of worth.", :useful=>[2.0, 2], :username=>"Swati", :date=>"Dec  4, 2013", :location=>nil, :title=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"metacritic", :url=>"http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-return-of-the-king"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"For Jackson to shoot The Lord of the Rings with a local crew in New Zealand, a country at the edge of the world with little stake in its doings, is a marvel which may only be repeated by Jackson himself.

Saying that, at the time of writing this, The Hobbit trilogy is obviously in full swing, but it's a prequel, so this technically is the end. Just when we thought there was a silver lining after the events of the Two Towers, the battle of Helms Deep was mesmerising yet tragic, but a victory was in toe, yet as we kick off Return of the King, we realise that was only the tip of the iceberg, as Gandalf (Ian McKellan), King Theodin (Bernard Hill), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rys-Davies) continue their quest to stop the powerful Sauron, who is changing the very landscape of Middle Earth. Aragorn again plays a pivotal part in the finale, attempting to take back a throne that is rightfully his, Mortensen excellently shows so much development of his character over the three films, always fighting the good fight while looking out for those who matter most, now in the midst of leading a rebellion against Mordor. But the real journey still soldiers on with Frodo (Elijah Wood) as he edges ever closer to Mordor, but the ring continues to overburden him, alienating his only friend, Sam (Sean Astin), who can't seem to do right, he continuously warns his friend of the threat of Gollum (Andy Serkis), who has a more expansive role here, we see his humble beginnings as one of the river folk, with his eventual descent into madness well documented. These three must take a secret passage into flaming city in the hope of destroying the ring. What also comes to mind is that these Frodo and company haven't seen any of the original Fellowship since the first film, they aren't aware that Gandalf is alive, but Gandalf himself now knows that the hobbits are still around, we get the sense of hope from his face that they were indeed around only days before. Almost every scene in the film proves significant, they all feel like closing moments of a long-running show, each character we have come to know over the films have very important roles to play in how the war will pan out, even the accidental travellers of Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), who proved more than useful in the fall of Saruman (Christopher Lee).

Many will argue the ridiculousness of such a tale as this story comes into full play, debating whether they pack the emotional punch or relevancy of other masterful pieces, but take a look at how much an audience loves to get lost in a supernatural or fantasy world, and why shouldn't they? There is so much to relate to with these characters and the journey they have taken and where it will go, something we can do as well.

It was released in 2003, following the previous two film, The Two Towers and The Fellowship of the Ring. Its success in the box office made it the 2nd most grossing film of all time back then. Then, a year after it's release, the folm got nominated for 11 Academy Awards. It went on to win all of them. Never had a film done so well financially, critically and with fans. Yes, this sparked one of the biggest franchise makings ever. With the longest lenght of game ever, one of the most character figures in stores, and so much more. Fans were never more pleased. And so, here I write the review on The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King, the film that changed the entertainment industry forever. The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King is based in the fictional world of Middle Earth. It follows a young Hobbit, Frodo, and his guides and friends (The Fellowiship of the RIng) as the journey on a quest to destroy the Ring and to bring man back to it's rightful throne. In the first film, the quest begins, in the second one, it is continued and more complexity is brought to the plot, and in the third film, it is at it's climax and is concluded. On the quest, the Fellowship seperates form the fact that they were attacked by a battalion of Orcs. They are seperated into 3 groups; Frodo and Sam; Pippin and Merry; and Gimli, Legolas, and Aragorn (who are later meet up with Gandalf). We follow all three of the groups as they fight, survive, and save Middle Earth.This film is like no other I have ever seen. And for that, i have to break it down into five parts. (1) Story (2) Acting (3) Vissuals and Cinematgrophy (4) Score (5) Directing.(1) Story; When JRR Tolken fisrt wrote The Hobbit, he knew he could get farther with the story. After years of writing, he finally came up with The Lord of the RIngs. When Peter JAckson first started filming the movies, people said it couldn't be done. But oh, were they wrong. Never have I seen such a complex, exciting, and moving story come to the big screen. It's spectacular sense of drama and action all put into one is a masterpiece. Story: 10/10(2) I don't know what idiots run the Academy, but I can tell you that they are some stupid people. To rob this fillm of any acting NOMINATION is just sad, sad supidity. When you got the only good acting from a fantasy film ever, you might as well congratulate it with atleast a nomination. But no, just go and screw up the voting proccess with not adding any actors from this film to the ballot. With the best acting coming from Viggo Mortenson, a supporting actor, he brought so much fun to the dull parts and to the exciting parts of thr film, as well. Elijah Wood also brought clear emotion and pain to his character, which is what was needed to make his character perfect. And he did make it perfect. Acting: 10/10(3) When it comes to visuals and cinematgrophy, this film had the very best. Angles that blew your breatha way, and special effects that looked so real that you could tough it, critics just knew nothing could beat this in those two aspects (besides Avatar). With years of designing beasts, creatures, and other organisms for Middle Earth, the special effects team put those long years to good use. One scene, in which Gandalf and Pippin are climbing to the top of Minis Tirith, the angles and use of camera were so amazing, that no place on Earth could rest your pleading for Middle Earth to be real. But sadly, it's only real in the film, and that's good enough for me. Visuals and Cinematography: 10/10(4) Score: Howard Shore's score for this film brought a sense of amazement, such as John Williams did to Star Wars. Intensity, sadness, and joy were all felt in the making of thsi score. When the score was needed most, this film gladly used it to it's best extent. I advise everyone reading this review to check it out one YouTube, for it can go with almost anything you're doing (peeling potatoes, drying yourself with a tower, etc.) The Academy Award winning song \"Into the Woods\" is being played while I write this review. Yup, one of the best scores ever. Score: 101/10(5) Directing; Saving the best for last, the directing. Peter Jackson brought every, freakin good part from the books to every freakin scene in the film. 'Nuff said.So, as I complete my longest review ever, I just wantn to say to all the haters: You guys hate, us lovers will love. Now this is probably my most unproffesional review, for I am just loving it and loving it for no reason. But you don't need reason to know that the best film in the world is the best for it's brotherhood, friendship, and love; The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King.10/10", :useful=>[6.0, 8], :username=>"Shahmeer", :date=>"May 15, 2011", :location=>nil, :title=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"metacritic", :url=>"http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-return-of-the-king"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"Just to warn you, this might be my longest review.

Had I known Tolkien's classic was in the hands of the guy who directed Heavenly Creatures, I would have been more optimistic. As it turns out, my expectations were completely overturned. In some ways the films are actually better than the books, especially in terms of emotional power. Competent actors, amazing cinematography, and a brilliant music score combine to offer us Middle-Earth as we'd never imagined it.Fellowship of the Ring is the most polished film, with its elegant episodic pacing. We start in the idyllic world of the hobbits and flee with Ringwraiths hot on our heels; we rest in Elrond's sanctuary and plunge into Moria; we come out grieving and console ourselves in Galadriel's safe (yet unsettling) dream-wood, and then wind up surrounded by Uruk-hai. This is a quintessential fantasy road-journey containing three episodes within an episode, each beginning in a haven and followed by a dark journey. The pacing is flawless, and the plot unfolds to a perfect beat.Two Towers is the ambiguous film. It's excellent (or at least the extended version is) but structured in a way that the hobbits become sidelined by the Rohan story. As they are the soul of Tolkien's epic, we feel slightly nonplussed at their consignment to B-storylines. Ironically, the film is a showcase for cgi characters Gollum and Treebeard, who manage to steal the show from within these storylines.Return of the King is the most dramatic film, tragic on almost a biblical level, and certainly the most satisfying. I can understand why Elijah Wood calls it \"better than one and two combined\". It centers on the hopeless mission to Mount Doom, which, as every fan knows, is the heart of the story. Around this we're bombarded by apocalyptic chaos and destruction on the Pelennor Fields, followed by Aragorn's hopeless march on the Black Gate. We finish at the Grey Havens, the best ending in literary and cinematic history, which encapsulates all of Tolkien's themes: courage, friendship, suffering, and passing on. It just doesn't get better than this.Peter Jackson deserves more accolades than I'm capable of heaping to the point of overkill. Minor quibbles aside, the extended versions of these films are masterpieces to be treasured as much as the books. Tolkien's classic may be pure, but the movie's cinematography takes us where even the written word cannot go. Tolkien's writing is irreplaceable, but Howard Shore's music taps deeper into Middle-Earth's soul.

The July 26, 2004 San Diego Comic Convention featured a preview of many scenes, some introduced by Peter Jackson himself.  (Some of these scenes were recently featured in the sneak preview trailer at Lord of the Rings.net, although now it seems to have been removed).  In reference to a couple of reviews on the board here -- if you're waiting anxiously for the Scouring of the Shire, don't hold your breath.  That segment was NEVER filmed by Jackson, therefore it will NOT be included in the extended edition DVD.  But there ARE plenty of great scenes to be included:·  We hear Christopher Lee's booming voice echoed over a dark screen that lightened to reveal Saruman on top of Orthanc. He warns our heroes of something festering in the heart of Middle-earth and that they will all die.·  We see Frodo and Sam in their Orc disguises joining the column of Orcs as they march out of Mordor.·  There are numerous shots of the Houses of Healing with Faramir, Eowyn, and Merry all seen.·  A lot more looks to be added to the siege of Minas Tirith, as there was a bunch of new battle footage.·  Frodo and Sam venture into the Crossroads and a few clips from that section were included.·  The Mouth of Sauron is featured pretty heavily. If you've played EA's Return of the King video game you'll recognize the scene. The Mouth of Sauron rides out of the Black Gate and presents Frodo's mithril coat to the Fellowship.·  Aragorn reveals himself to Sauron by approaching the Palantir in Minas Tirith and wields Anduril to show that the Heir of Elendil was alive.·  We get to see more of Saruman later in the preview when he knocks Wormtongue down and also fires a giant fireball from his staff that engulfs Gandalf on Shadowfax.·  There's more of Frodo and Sam in Mordor after they join the column of Orcs and before they discard their disguises. In one scene, Sam looks to the dark sky of Mordor and tells Frodo that he can see light as one little star can be seen glimmering through the clouds.·  And yes, we will finally get to see Gandalf facing down the Witch King. It happens exactly as we've seen, but when Gandalf holds up his staff the Witch King pulls out his sword and holds it to the sky where it spouts flames. As he brings it down, the air around the burning sword is distorted.That was just the preview. New Line treated fans to three full clips, with the third introduced by Peter Jackson himself:·  There was a nice scene of Pippin and Faramir in Gondor where Faramir explains to the Hobbit how the small Gondorian armor he was wearing belonged to a young son of the Steward when he was a kid. Faramir further explains how Boromir was always the soldier and he wasn't.·  A scene that takes place about five days after they were healed by Aragorn features Faramir and Eowyn on a balcony at the Houses of Healing where Eowyn falls for Faramir.·  The Paths of the Dead is extended from where it ends in the theatrical cut. After Aragorn poses his offer, the dead laugh and go back into the walls. A massive earthquake starts, and the Three Hunters must escape an avalanche of millions of skulls.·  Described, but not shown, another scene expanded in this edition is the scene where Pippin finds Merry on the battlefield. Now, Pippin searches the field for an entire day after everyone else has gone back into the city. He finally locates Merry at night in the new version of the scene.

That's all I can really say for this film. It was inspirational, beautiful, heartrenching, and captivating, making this film amazing. Jackson truly outdid himself for Return of the King. The hopelessness and pain Sam and Frodo are experiencing as they struggle to destroy the Ring is so wonderfully done that you truly feel as if you are with Sam and Frodo as they struggle to climb up the mountain. The love and friendship between the two is so moving that it seriously brought tears to my eyes, and I *rarely* cry.The acting was simply superb in this film, especially Sean Astin (Sam) and Viggo Mortenson (Aragorn). As always, Miranda Otto was wonderful as Eowyn, as were Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan as Pippin and Merry. The movie flowed exceptionally, and despite its lengthy time, there was not a moment that I wasn't captivated by Tolkien's vision of Middle-earth. One of the lines that stands out the most to me is during the moment when Sam and Frodo believe they are going to die while Mt. Doom is erupting is, \"I'm glad to be with you, Sam. Here, at the end of all things.\" Another beautiful scene is when Aragorn, crowned as the King of Gondor, bows down to the hobbits, telling them, \"You bow to no one.\" The heartfelt emotion expressed really does make this film the greatest of all three.As always, the everpresent rivalry between Gimli and Legolas is there, providing comic relief. Surprisingly, Merry and Pippin do not provide any humour other than at the beginning of the film, and are a very chief point in the plot. The two are separated for the first time since the triligy began and must mature, which largely develops their character. The lovable Smeagol has now once more become the treacherous Gollum; though in the beginning Smeagol pleads against his darker side, the Ring takes control of him, adding to the list of enemies.Fans of the book will happy to find that Shelob is in this movie; in the books it was originally in the second. Also, the Sword that was Broken is in the film as well, while in the book it is carried by Aragorn in all three. Peter Jackson also remains faithful to the warrior side of Eowyn, which is touched upon in the second film. Though the Houses of Healing were cut out, hopefully they will be in the extended DVD version of the film.I really can't do this movie justice. It's impossible to explain how I felt both times I saw the movie as I saw the struggle of Frodo and Sam. This movie isn't just a war-movie, or a fantasy movie; it's a movie about love and trust, finding hope in a world that has none, about companionship and fighting until the very end. All three and a half hours of this film is exceptional, and will surely be a classic for years to come.", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[178, 198], :date=>" 2004 January 7", :title=>"A Masterpiece", :username=>nil, :location=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"amazon", :url=>"http://www.amazon.com/The-Lord-Rings-Widescreen-Theatrical/product-reviews/B00005JKZY"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"...wow.", :clean_text=>"...wow.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"That's all I can really say for this film.", :clean_text=>"that's all i can really say for this film.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>2, :text=>"It was inspirational, beautiful, heartrenching, and captivating, making this film amazing.", :clean_text=>"it was inspirational beautiful heartrenching and captivating making this film amazing.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{:vision=>20}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>3, :text=>"Jackson truly outdid himself for Return of the King.", :clean_text=>"jackson truly outdid himself for return of the king.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>4, :text=>"The hopelessness and pain Sam and Frodo are experiencing as they struggle to destroy the Ring is so wonderfully done that you truly feel as if you are with Sam and Frodo as they struggle to climb up the mountain.", :clean_text=>"the hopelessness and pain sam and frodo are experiencing as they struggle to destroy the ring is so wonderfully done that you truly feel as if you are with sam and frodo as they struggle to climb up the mountain.", :sentiment=>-2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>5, :text=>"The love and friendship between the two is so moving that it seriously brought tears to my eyes, and I *rarely* cry.The acting was simply superb in this film, especially Sean Astin (Sam) and Viggo Mortenson (Aragorn).", :clean_text=>"the love and friendship between the two is so moving that it seriously brought tears to my eyes and i rarely cry.the acting was simply superb in this film especially sean astin sam and viggo mortenson aragorn).", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{:cast=>100}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>["Viggo Mortensen", "Sean Astin"], :people_indexes=>[["Sean Astin", [[170]]]]}, {:index=>6, :text=>"As always, Miranda Otto was wonderful as Eowyn, as were Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan as Pippin and Merry.", :clean_text=>"as always miranda otto was wonderful as eowyn as were billy boyd and dominic monaghan as pippin and merry.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>["Billy Boyd", "Dominic Monaghan", "Miranda Otto"], :people_indexes=>[["Billy Boyd", [[56]]], ["Dominic Monaghan", [[61]]], ["Miranda Otto", [[11]]]]}, {:index=>7, :text=>"The movie flowed exceptionally, and despite its lengthy time, there was not a moment that I wasn't captivated by Tolkien's vision of Middle-earth.", :clean_text=>"the movie flowed exceptionally and despite its lengthy time there was not a moment that i wasn't captivated by tolkien's vision of middle-earth.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>8, :text=>"One of the lines that stands out the most to me is during the moment when Sam and Frodo believe they are going to die while Mt.

I had been afraid that our beloved books would be taken by a talentless, indifferent hand and thrown into the horrendous money-making machine. I had been afraid they'd be ground mercilessly and without any consideration for J.R.R. Tolkien's work or for its fans, ground into pieces of overbudgeted FX with not much else left to the eye and to the mind.What we got instead was nothing short of a masterpiece. Hype? Sure, there's been some hype. But The Lord Of The Rings has rendered the word hype obsolete. It takes that hype and smashes it against a wall of pure brilliance. The final installment is a glorious ending to a trilogy that decades down the road, I have no doubt, will be hailed as one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema. Had I written the review right after seeing it, it would've probably consisted of one word. WHOA. But I'm OK now. I'm fine. I've taken my Advil, drank my three cups of coffee, got good five hours of sleep. I'm OK now. I can finally sit down and write a coherent review.On the other hand, do I dare? What can you say about a movie which is, for the lack of a better word, perfect? I know, I know. Of course, no movie is perfect. But this one is as damn well close to perfect as it gets. I've been literally put under a spell, very similar to the one that had seized my mind 18 years ago when I first read the books. Flaws and lowdowns? Sure, there are some, but only if you choose to be a grumpy purist who refuses to get it through his head that literature and cinema are two very different media and therefore cannot be the same, will never be the same. This is as great an adaptation as there will ever be. Call me when you make a movie one-tenth this good.In my eyes, the films are in some ways better than the books. I find it extremely annoying that Tolkien's work is being idealized by his fans. He was but a man and he, too, made mistakes. His books, as detailed and amazing as they are, still aren't perfect. There are characters who do nothing but sit around, scenes the very presence of which is meaningless or at the very least questionable. Think Arwen, think Tom Bombadil... who, while making a part of the story cool and magical, bears next to no impact on the story as a whole (of course, \"true Tolkien fans\" will probably have my head if they read this, but oh well). But above all, it makes my blood boil when I hear things like \"a true visualization of Tolkien's Middle-earth it is not\" (sic. Rogert Ebert). With all due respect, who in the world do you think you are to decide what a \"true visualization of Tolkien's world\" is? No one but Tolkien himself can give us the true visualization of his world, and he's been dead for decades.Peter Jackson & Co had a task in front of them akin to dragging a cross to the top of Golgotha, in metaphorical terms. And, by all that's sacred, I cannot see how a filmmaker could succeed more in such a task. It is no small feat to accomplish what they have accomplished. Not only have they succeeded, they have exceeded all my expectations. You can see and feel with every shot that this is a labor of love. That goes for everything and everyone in the movie. Cinematographically, it's amazing. The FX were just enough and never cheesy or unnecessary. The score moves you deeply - even the normally annoying Enya did not bother me this time. The acting was splendid, and the cast was simply perfect. I grew up with the characters in my heart, and now they finally have faces. I mean, how many times do you actually read a book, imagine the characters, and then see the movie and realize that the characters look eerily close to what you've imagined them to look like?I could go further into details about this particular installment, but I don't think Amazon supports reviews that long. I will simply say that I have never been one of those never-happy purists who nitpick even on the quantity of leaves on trees in Rivendell. I believe these movies should be seen for what they are, not for what they are not. Don't sit there and compare it to the book, or complain how something was added or taken away. Know this: if you want to see Tolkien's Middle Earth, you never will. Only Tolkien himself could give you his Middle Earth, and he's long gone. Look at these films from an overall point of view and try to see that it is simply impossible to film such a leviathan in a way that will make everyone happy. And for what it is, this trilogy is a rare gem. It combines end-of-your-seat action with heartbreaking drama, and brings intensity on both visual and emotional levels, which few films have accomplished so far. For me personally, it was also a memorable experience because I got to share it with a hundreds of moviegoers who sat in the theater with me for three years in a row. We watched in silence, lest we miss anything. We wowed at the sight of the dark, vast Moria, the surreal beauty of Rivendell, the fiery grandeur of Mt. Doom. We laughed at the hobbits' painfully sweet naiveté. We clapped at the grand finale. We couldn't hold back tears in the last few minutes before the credits rolled. We were there, with them, sharing this timeless tale of friendship, destiny, love, the loss of innocence and the reign of good vs. evil. Sounds trite, I know.

He is a friend of my youngest brother (17 years old, in High School), and I figured that if he was watching these films for the first time, he might as well watch the extended editions.He saw Fellowship 2 weekends ago and loved it.  Then he saw the Two Towers last Saturday, and was very eager to see the final chapter.  Incidentally, the last extended edition was out this past Tuesday, and yesterday, my brother, this friend and I sat for the Return of the King and watched it from beginning to end, integrated scenes and all.To be able to see the expressions of shock, wonder, suprise, and conviction as someone watches the Lord of the Rings movies for the first time; the feelings of cinematic release that I myself went through when I was introduced to these films, is quite hard to put in words.  Let's just say another fan has been added to the list.Just as magical was being able to suprise and shock my younger brother and his friends even more with the enriched history and sheer emotion of the books; describing the last chapter in the \"Two Towers\", and how intense 'The Choices of Master Samwise' is as you read it, and how you do not want to stop reading the rest of the story until the very cracks of Mount Doom have come and gone; seeing their eyes widen and their curiousity abound as I explain the history behind some of the amazing detail that has been included in these films, like Shelob's mother (Ungolianth), or Erendil's light; the saga of the Valar and the Silmarillon, and Morgorth and his many Balrogs.The best part of this experience in Middle Earth is more personal.  Last night my younger brother and his friend asked why, once the climax had passed, there was a need to show so much of the aftermath.  I realised then that while it took courage for Frodo and the fellowship to fight their battles and face their fears, especially with almost no hope; once the worst arrived, and the sacrifices were made, a new courage was needed, to face life after 'The End of All things', and to continue to live it.  I told them about the casualties of war, and how so many soldiers who have served and suffered, return home, only to find their lives can no longer be the same.  Many do not know how to go on living a normal life after experiencing the horror and pain that comes from war.  It takes courage to keep on living, to find happiness that brings peace.For me, this movie shows what courage is like - it shows the many forms of courage.  Not 6 months ago, my other, older brother (27 years old, graphic designer) died very suddenly, and tragically.  One moment very close, the next, ripped out of my life; once living and breathing, funny and God fearing, my mentor - my friend; now, only memories - many, many good, some sad, all, usually painful.  It takes courage to persevere past the pain of losing a loved one, and struggling, fighting to find meaning, happiness, and faith in life - happiness that will bring peace.These movies are much more than entertainment or great cinema, they are instruments of hope, spanning the spectrum of life's deepest sorrows, and most meaningful truths.

should win the Oscar for best picture, and for three reasons:  first, it was easily the best big-budget film of the year.  The only films that I believe rival it in quality are small budget films:  LOST IN TRANSLATION and AMERICAN SPLENDOUR.  Sometimes independent films can pull upsets, but I really don't expect them to this year.  Second, except for the independent films, there isn't a lot of competition this year, unlike the past two years.  Many of the films that were expected to vie for the Oscar have been greeted with some fairly negative reviews, like COLD MOUNTAIN, or mild indifference, like THE LAST SAMURAI.  One of the better-reviewed films of the fall, MASTER AND COMMANDER, is a very good adventure film that possesses no obvious advantages over THE RETURN OF THE KING.  Third, the Academy has a tendency to correct past neglects.  Sometimes this can lead to tragic results, such as 1940 when Jimmy Stewart received the Oscar for Best Actor for THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, to atone for his having not received one in 1939 for MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON.  The tragedy lay in the fact that Stewart's best friend Henry Fonda therefore failed to win for his near legendary performance as Tom Joad in THE GRAPES OF WRATH, one of the greatest performances in the history of American cinema.  But in 2004, I expect LORD OF THE RINGS to justly win not merely for the excellence of the third installment of the saga, but for the overall greatness of the three films.The LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy is unquestionably one of the most successful cinematic treatments of a beloved work of literature the movies have ever seen.  I know there are purists who would not have been satisfied by any conceivable film version, and that there are others who are more justifiably bothered by the omission of Tom Bombadil or the schizophrenic treatment of Gollum, but I think anyone willing to cut the movie even the tiniest bit of slack should be able to grant to the great achievement that this movie turned out to be.  Of course, ironically it was only the growth of CGI technology that made the filming of this fantasy of lost ancient past possible.  Twenty years ago, it would have been inconceivable that Treebeard could have been so satisfyingly come to life.  Or Gollum.  Or seeing hobbits, humans, elves, dwarves, wizards, and orcs all onscreen at the same time.  I can honestly say that there was not a moment that I was consciously looking at special effects rather than balrogs or giant flying eagles or gigantic walking trees.But all of this could be a kind of criticism--namely, that the success of the film depends merely on technology--if it weren't for the fact that the movie succeeds on multiple levels.  The art design is the most memorable I can ever remember.  I'll forever think of those beautiful pins for the capes that Frodo and Samwise wear all the way from Rivendale to Mordor.  The makers of the film got more things right than they needed to, perfecting more detail than anyone could possibly have noticed.  Without great acting, however, all of the technology and special effects and art and set design would be a royal place setting for junk, but fortunately the film was both marvelously cast and wonderfully acted.  There might have been one or two casting decisions I might have questioned, but by and large the cast was stellar, a few so magnificently that it difficult now to see anyone else in that role.  When the film was first announced, much of the debate was over who would portray Gandalf, and I remember some people being upset that not only was Sean Connery (the early favorite) not cast but an openly gay actor in the role instead.  But it is now almost impossible to imagine anyone but Ian McKellan in the role.  So many smaller roles made the film work, like David Wenham as Faramir (seen only a couple of years ago in the role of \"Audrey\" in MOULIN ROUGE), or Ian Holm as Bilbo, or Sean Bean as Boromir, or Cate Blanchett as Galadriel.  The only weakness in the movie is one that probably couldn't be overcome (and one that Peter Jackson has acknowledged in interviews):  Sauron.  What can you do with a bad guy who is merely a giant flaming eyeball?  Just not much potential to do much more than what they were able to do.Peter Jackson deserves a special academy award for serving as the creative force that turned THE LORD OF THE RINGS into one of the great experiences in the history of cinema.  Most of all, he deserves enormous credit for making all the technology subservient to the story, and not the other way around.  The great battle for Minas Tirith might have devolved into a mere showcase for stellar special effects, like many moments in the past two STAR WARS films have, but not once did he lose touch with the human element, not there or at any other point.", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[170, 203], :date=>" 2004 January 18", :title=>"A stellar climax to a truly great cinematic experience", :location=>"(Chicago, IL USA)", :username=>"Robert Moore", :source=>{:vendor=>"amazon", :url=>"http://www.amazon.com/The-Lord-Rings-Widescreen-Theatrical/product-reviews/B00005JKZY"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING should win the Oscar for best picture, and for three reasons:  first, it was easily the best big-budget film of the year.", :clean_text=>"lord of the rings the return of the king should win the oscar for best picture and for three reasons first it was easily the best big-budget film of the year.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>9.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"The only films that I believe rival it in quality are small budget films:  LOST IN TRANSLATION and AMERICAN SPLENDOUR.", :clean_text=>"the only films that i believe rival it in quality are small budget films lost in translation and american splendour.", :sentiment=>-2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>5.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>2, :text=>"Sometimes independent films can pull upsets, but I really don't expect them to this year.", :clean_text=>"sometimes independent films can pull upsets but i really don't expect them to this year.", :sentiment=>1, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>3, :text=>"Second, except for the independent films, there isn't a lot of competition this year, unlike the past two years.", :clean_text=>"second except for the independent films there isn't a lot of competition this year unlike the past two years.", :sentiment=>1, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>4, :text=>"Many of the films that were expected to vie for the Oscar have been greeted with some fairly negative reviews, like COLD MOUNTAIN, or mild indifference, like THE LAST SAMURAI.", :clean_text=>"many of the films that were expected to vie for the oscar have been greeted with some fairly negative reviews like cold mountain or mild indifference like the last samurai.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>5.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>5, :text=>"One of the better-reviewed films of the fall, MASTER AND COMMANDER, is a very good adventure film that possesses no obvious advantages over THE RETURN OF THE KING.", :clean_text=>"one of the better-reviewed films of the fall master and commander is a very good adventure film that possesses no obvious advantages over the return of the king.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>9.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>6, :text=>"Third, the Academy has a tendency to correct past neglects.", :clean_text=>"third the academy has a tendency to correct past neglects.", :sentiment=>1, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>7, :text=>"Sometimes this can lead to tragic results, such as 1940 when Jimmy Stewart received the Oscar for Best Actor for THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, to atone for his having not received one in 1939 for MR.

The release of the extended edition of ROTK is arguably the most anticipated DVD event of the whole year, and with good reason.  I'm assuming that everyone who is interested this early has read about the extra goodies we can expect from Jackson and Co.  Things like the Mouth of Sauron, the orc-march with Sam and Frodo, and (my personal favorite) the blossoming relationship between Eowyn and Faramir, not to mention a whole host of others.  I guess the Extended Editions prove the exception to the rule that less is more.  50 extra minutes is a long time, even compared with the original hefty running time of 3 1/2 hours.  I'm heartily anticipating the numbing my rear is going to receive.When you think about it, The Lord of the Rings should never have happened.  At least, not in this day and age.  We're talking about an unknown director, with no previous experience in epic filmaking, a special effects workhouse in *New Zealand*, of all places, and a smallish production company that really couldn't afford to make a gamble of this magnitude and expect to recover if they lost.  Still, Jackson certainly made sure they got their money's worth, even before the movies became hits.  He made three movies, each over 3 hours long, with copious special effects and a huge cast, for $300 million.  Titanic, a single movie, while admittedly a very ambitious one, had a price tag of about $400 million.  I have no idea how Jackson did it, and I don't need to know.  Even if he never makes another movie as good as LOTR (God forbid!), he will go down in filmaking history as the man who was able to translate an untranslateable classic to the big screen, and still do it justice.  How many \"serious\" directors can claim that feat, even with less ambitious books?Now, for those who claim LOTR is a lesson for our time, you may very well be right.  Then again, you might not.  Either way, it really doesn't matter.  We all see what we want to see, but I think I'll trust the author's view in this case.  Tolkien was famously contemptuous of allegory, and the least we can do for him is to honor his request that the books (and the movies) be read and seen for themselves, without bringing our own prejudices and justifications into it, at least not on purpose.So, here's to the final leg of the journey.

It looked cool at the time, but my teenage brain couldn't handle anything past the loud voices and constant cussing, but kudos for style points. The second time I saw it (maybe another 12 years after the first) I believe it was supposed to be a DVD rip, but the sound encoding was atrocious, so I only enjoyed it in part. The the third time I saw it (about 3 months ago) was off of Netflix streaming with decent enough audio, but not so great video. Ironically enough, the one time I finally get to see and hear the darn thing with quality A/V is on Blu-ray. That being said, it should go without question by user vote on IMDb, critic appraisal, or any number of awards and accolades given to this film that Pulp Fiction has cemented itself as a true game-changer in the halls of cinema legend. Be it the achronological storytelling, the sassy script, the dark humor, the quirky characters, or just the amazing level of star power involved from every which way, there's a lot to like about this film. For me, personally, it's the method. I don't mean the cut-up timeline (which is enjoyable in itself and keeps you on your toes), but how so much of the dialogue is \"just there\" from a purely jovial or character-developing perspective. Talks of Amsterdam and their legalization of drugs, the differences between European and American culture, the frivolous comparison between a foot massage and going down on a girl, the significantly comedic monologue of a P.O.W. storing his best friend's watch up his anus for years only to deliver it to his son, and all kinds of other seemingly random stuff \"capped off\" by a stride at redemption would make you think otherwise about this being nominated for seven Oscars, right? Well, as most people often say about Quentin Tarantino films, \"you should just see it for yourself to know what I mean.\" And the result after almost 20 years? It's a part of our modern day pop culture with all kinds of quotable lines, a beacon of entertainment and inspiration within the industry,and, for all intents and purposes, one really fun movie to watch. Is it for everyone? Of course not. But most would say it is.Video - 5.0- Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC- Video resolution: 1080p- Aspect ratio: 2.35:1- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1The front and back of the slipcover and the back of the cover art says that this transfer was supervised by Quentin Tarantino himself and even has a copy of his signature on the slip, so what you see here was what the director intended. And I have to say, after 3 very poor video outings (VHS, a crappy DVD rip, and Netflix streaming), I have to say I've never seen the movie look this good (literally). The production budget was only $8 million, which by today's standards would still only be about $12 million. But wow, am I glad Tarantino used some quality film stock. First and foremost, I have to commend the black levels. All the tiny little details, linings, reflections, and textures look absolutely pristine on this presentation. Particularly, the wetness of Jules' Jheri curl, as laughable as the look is intended to be, adds a nice aesthetic sense of throwback to the Blaxploitation genre that Mr. Jackson's character is portraying. And then you have the hallmark scene where Vincent is taking Mia to Jack Rabbit Slim's, which is FULL of dark lighting, and yet still manages to display an amazing amount of detail around the restaurant itself, its patrons, on Thurman's hair, and in Travolta's suit in addition to the smoke he's blowing. Colors, while somewhat muted from an art direction standpoint, are surprisingly bold. The scene where Butch is taking money from Marsellus in the bar is full of red light, but in comparison to other brightly red-lit backdrops (which isn't many), I'm pleased at how a lot of the detail still remained intact. Then, of course, is the blood. Maybe it was more so the stuff they used to be the blood, but when it splatters, it looks great. Not real per se, but it's one of those artistic subtleties that Tarantino does well in his films. I am also happy to report that there is very little, if any, hints of dirt or artifacting. There's a fine layer of grain (and I mean very fine), but it doesn't seem like any DNR was added. Edge Enhancement? Not too sure, I'm typing this review with only 4 hours of sleep and might've seen a tiny little bit, but it's hard to say when I'm not all there. Regardless, though, I can tell you everything else looks superb, especially for its age.Audio - 5.0Languages- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1Subtitles- English, English SDH, SpanishAnother big part of Tarantino's films outside of its aesthetic and literary homages is the sound, particularly the music. As soon as Surf Rider starts playing it's easy to tell that this DTS-HD MA 5.1 track will do its job and do it well. LFEs are at their most prominent when any of this great soundtrack starts playing. Even as the radio switches to Jungle Boogie in the opening sequence, there's not a discrepancy to be heard. But how do the rest of the sound elements hold up on this seemingly quaint sound design? I mean, how can 230 pages of script possibly earn a 5 point rating? Oddly enough, this film's sound scape has a LOT of immersion. Shortly after the credits have done their thing we get a great audio treat in the first scene where Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are contemplating their change in venue for an upcoming robbery. I actually wouldn't even know this if I hadn't accessed all the extras, but the trivia track says that even in this very first scene, despite the achoronlogical plot structure, if you listen hard enough during Pumpkin and Honey Bunny's conversation you can distinctly hear Jules talking to Vincent in the background from a scene to be shown later on in the film. How cool is that? And while the weak point of the sound effects may be in the meager gunshots, the sheer sense of engulfment that every other crowded scene has to offer is sonic gold. Directionality and separation sound wonderful during these parts putting you right there in the thick of things. Meanwhile, high and low ends still manage to be very well-calibrated, specifically in the scene where Mia is getting her adrenaline shot between all the paper raffling around and the eventual thump on her chest. Oh yeah, and the dialogue couldn't be any clearer. From Jules' intimidating preacher vibrato to Fabienne's sweet and sexy accented-English, the movie has never looked OR sounded better. My favorite scenes to test the audio would be the aforementioned robbery attempt at the beginning of the film and the always-exalting trademark scene of Vincent and Mia going to Jack Rabbit Slim's (when they walk to their table and when they start dancing).Extras - 5.0Wow, I should really have taken a nap before work instead of trying to rush this review out for everyone to get a fresh take on the product, but I'm glad I at least got to learn a lot of things despite my soon-to-be headache at the crap hole at which I work. At any rate, this BD is loaded with extras. Most of them are DVD ports, but I'd never seen this on DVD anyway, and thus, am just seeing all of this for the very first time.- Not the Usual Mindless Boring Getting to Know You Chit Chat (HD; 43:01)A new HD retrospective with most of the film's actors discussing how they were cast, how the shooting went, and all of the things that ensued after the film came out. There's a lot of information here about the movie itself, its writing, and how a lot of the actors felt working with Tarantino.- Here are Some Facts on the Fiction (HD; 20:37)Another newly-produced featurette that shows a roundtable discussion with critics and their thoughts on how Pulp Fiction has affected the industry, their favorite parts, and some of the things that make the movie so good.- Pulp Fiction: The Facts - Documentary (SD; 30:31)Is from the Special Edition DVD (as is everything else from here on out) and is something of a mishmash of the pre-production, filming, and reception of the movie up to 2001.- Deleted Scenes (SD; 24:30)Feature commentary for 4 out of the 5 scenes by Tarantino and are enjoyable, if you want to at least take a one-time look.- Siskel & Ebert At the Movies: The Tarantino Generation (SD; 16:00)Is a short look at the quick rise of Tarantino's status and whether or not they think he was legit at the time. It comes off rather pretentious, though, so I wouldn't recommend it.- Charlie Rose Show (SD; 55:27)Features a GREAT interview with Tarantino and discusses a lot of his film-making roots, his philosophy as a movie-lover, and what he believes makes a good film.- Independent Spirit Awards (SD; 11:29)- Cannes Film Festival - Palme D'Or Acceptance Speech (SD; 5:20)- Marketing Gallery (SD; 16:13)Lots and lots of trailers/teasers.- Still Gallery- Enhanced Trivia TrackA trivia track that pops up all sorts of tidbits of information in the subtitles telling you all the quirks about the film itself, if any of you like that sort of thing (and some of it being very funny).Overall - 5.0As fervid as my review sounds, I'm actually not that big a fan of Tarantino. Aside from seeing this and Inglorious Basterds more than two times each, I've only seen his other films once. I didn't really get into Reservoir Dogs and the Kill Bills were stylish enough, but keep in mind it's been nearly five years since I've seen those, and five years is a lot of time for my brain to better develop. But to the point, yes, Pulp Fiction is definitely one of those films that somehow managed to turn a bunch of dialogue into a fun and raucous movie. It's well-written, especially well-acted, and is a good way to spend two and a half-hours. With top-notch A/V quality and over 3 hours of specials, an SRP of $19.99 is practically nothing for such an renowned title that finally made its way to a proper BD release.", :rating=>5.0,

Quentin Tarantino is a very gifted director/writer.  Although I love his directing, I must say it is his writing that really impresses me.  But I will get to that later on in this review.I think it's safe to say that the first time this movie was released on DVD, it was a little more than disappointing.  There were no special features, sound and picture was so-so; I mean, my laserdisk at least had three different trailers of the movie.  So, of course, I was very excited to learn that this movie was being re-released in a fully loaded special edition.  Re-buying the movie was well worth it, for this edition of the movie is far superior than the other one.The movie really consists of three different stories; not in any order.  Any one of the stories could be their own little movies.  The players are two hitmen, a boxer, the big boss, the big boss' wife, a crazy gun store owner, a gimp, a cop named, Zed, a man who makes problems go away, and a little suitcase with \"666\" for the combination.  You add all this together and you get one hell of a movie.The acting is more than superb; including one terrific cast with some heavy hitters (Travolta, Jackson, Thurman, Willis, etc.).  Tarantino is a master when it comes to writing and directing.  Especially when it comes to writing.  I have never heard such clever and brutally honest dialogue in any other movie.  I have said it before, and I will say it again; Tarantino reminds me of Raymond Carver, except with more humor.Now, on to the special edition of this DVD.  Is it better than the previous version?  YES!  Tons of special features, and not to forget the fact that the movie has been restored in high definition.  Picture looks very clear.  And the sound is also a lot better.  You can watch the movie in DTS, which is always a good thing.Special features.....where do I begin?  There's a ton of them!  It's not even funny how much stuff is loaded on this bad boy.  And every one of them is great.  Features include a documentary, an interview with Tarantino on \"The Charlie Rose Show,\" trailers, filmographies, and many more.  If you love special features, then you will not be disappointed.\"Pulp Fiction\" is a great movie, and the new DVD edition is outstanding in every way.  If you still have the older DVD of this movie, get this one now!  If you haven't seen it yet, check it out when you can!  Of course, with any other movie, there is a chance you may not like this movie.  That's fine, nothing wrong with that.  Don't let hype ruin your preception of the movie, just watch it as if it were any other movie.  You like it, great; if not, well, at least you gave it a shot.  Filled with sharp humor, great characters, outstanding dialogue, and some of the craziest surprises and twists, \"Pulp Fiction\" is a wonderful film, and will continue to be one of my favorites.", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[259, 307], :date=>" 2002 September 14", :title=>"\"Oh", :location=>"(Orland Park, IL USA)", :username=>"Michael Crane", :source=>{:vendor=>"amazon", :url=>"http://www.amazon.com/Pulp-Fiction-John-Travolta/product-reviews/1558908242"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"Words cannot express how much I love this movie, but I will try my best.", :clean_text=>"words cannot express how much i love this movie but i will try my best.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"\"Pulp Fiction\" is one of my favorites.", :clean_text=>"\"pulp fiction is one of my favorites.", :sentiment=>-1, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>2, :text=>"Quentin Tarantino is a very gifted director/writer.", :clean_text=>"quentin tarantino is a very gifted director/writer.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>["Quentin Tarantino"], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>3, :text=>"Although I love his directing, I must say it is his writing that really impresses me.", :clean_text=>"although i love his directing i must say it is his writing that really impresses me.", :sentiment=>1, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>["Quentin Tarantino"], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>4, :text=>"But I will get to that later on in this review.I think it's safe to say that the first time this movie was released on DVD, it was a little more than disappointing.", :clean_text=>"but i will get to that later on in this review.i think it's safe to say that the first time this movie was released on dvd it was a little more than disappointing.", :sentiment=>-2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>2.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>5, :text=>"There were no special features, sound and picture was so-so;

It was an independent release and its success opened the door up for all kinds of maverick filmmakers and companies to release films that otherwise would have never been made. It also had a profound stylistic influence. It was a hip movie with sharp dialogue, graphic violence, cool soundtrack and intricate plotlines. In the wake of its success, many movies try to copy this style, but most failed as they lacked Quentin Tarantino's unique vision. Mr. Tarantino was able to pull John Travolta out of a decade long funk and directed him to the finest performance of his career and one that garnered his second Academy Award nomination. He also pushed Bruce Willis to a stellar performance that showed he was more than just an action hero. The cast is first rate including a beguiling Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Eric Stolz, Rosanna Arquette and Christopher Walken. The best performance of all is given by Samuel L. Jackson who is absolutely amazing. It was a crime that he did not win the Academy Award for the role. Pulp Fiction is broken up into three parts and includes flashbacks, flash-forwards and twists and turns and some mysteries that are never revealed. It is a rare film that is both stylish and full of substance.  The new Collector's Edition is a huge step up from the original edition which offered virtually no extras.  The sound and visuals are crisper and cleaner and the extra features are great.

I own the DVD, but can't understand the shortage of extras. The laserdisc format has plenty of extras. For example it has the tralior and T.V. spots. Behind the scenes,  the Making of Pulp, the Charlie Rose interview with QT, and four deleted  scenes hosted by QT. Why couldn't we get those with the DVD format.  Hopefully in the near future, a re-release of the DVD will include these  goodies and maybe perhaps a Tarantino-Bender commentary track and a  director's cut of the complete film. The current DVD provides average  picture and sound. It is the best movie ever made and gets better each time  you watch it. You will also find out new things every time you view it. For  instance, the gun on Butch's counter didn't belong to Vincent, it belonged  to Wallace. Remember, Jules had already quit. Butch doesn't have any  intention in throwing the fight until Vincent picks a fight with him. It's  true, go back and watch how Butch acts while talking with Wallace and then  how mad he gets when Vincent starts with him.  Plus Fabeine is pregnant in  the movie, listen very closely to what she says. The movie also has a comic  side to it. I think it's funny how Vincent basically caused everything in  the movie. Just think, Vincent caused Mia's overdose by purchasing heroine  from Lance, in the first chapter. In the second chapter, \"The Gold  Watch,\" Vincent picks a fight with Butch. Then Butch throws the boxing  match. Then in \"The Bonnie Situation,\" Vincent tells Jules,  \"Do you feel like having breakfast?\" Then they go to the diner,  and you know what happens. Vincent is the films main character, and without  him there wouldn't have been a movie because he started all the problems.  Ask yourself these questions while viewing this. Why DON'T Vincent and  Jules die in the apartment? Why DO Vincent and Marvin die after  \"Devine Intervention?\" Why does Jules let Ringo LIVE? Why does  Butch go back to SAVE Wallace's life? What is in the BRIEFCASE? Tarantino  wasn't lazy when writing and directing this film. The more you watch it,  the more likely you'll have the answers to these questions and more. You  need to watch it more than two times to understand it. If you didn't like  it the first time, give it another try. This movie is NOT bad, overrated,  boring or too long like some people say. The actors are great and perfect  for thier roles. Any real movie fan will agree with me. People ask me what  the movie is about and its difficult to say. It's about a lot of things  like honor, pride, luck, faith and redemption.This is my favorite and the  greatest movie ever made!", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[51, 65], :date=>" 2000 February 9", :title=>"Pulp fans demand a better DVD", :location=>"(chicago)", :username=>"dvitoc", :source=>{:vendor=>"amazon", :url=>"http://www.amazon.com/Pulp-Fiction-John-Travolta/product-reviews/1558908242"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"This is of course the best film ever made.", :clean_text=>"this is of course the best film ever made.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"I own the DVD, but can't understand the shortage of extras.", :clean_text=>"i own the dvd but can't understand the shortage of extras.", :sentiment=>1, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>2, :text=>"The laserdisc format has plenty of extras.", :clean_text=>"the laserdisc format has plenty of extras.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>3, :text=>"For example it has the tralior and T.V. spots.", :clean_text=>"for example it has the tralior and t.v spots.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>4, :text=>"Behind the scenes,  the Making of Pulp, the Charlie Rose interview with QT, and four deleted  scenes hosted by QT.", :clean_text=>"behind the scenes the making of pulp the charlie rose interview with qt and four deleted scenes hosted by qt.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>2.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>5, :text=>"Why couldn't we get those with the DVD format.", :clean_text=>"why couldn't we get those with the dvd format.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>6, :text=>"Hopefully in the near future, a re-release of the DVD will include these  goodies and maybe perhaps a Tarantino-Bender commentary track and a  director's cut of the complete film.", :clean_text=>"hopefully in the near future a re-release of the dvd will include these goodies and maybe perhaps a tarantino-bender commentary track and a director's cut of the complete film.", :sentiment=>1, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>2.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>7, :text=>"The current DVD provides average  picture and sound.", :clean_text=>"the current dvd provides average picture and sound.", :sentiment=>1, :context_tags=>{:sound=>100}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>8, :text=>"It is the best movie ever made and gets better each time  you watch it.", :clean_text=>"it is the best movie ever made and gets better each time you watch it.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>9, :text=>"You will also find out new things every time you view it.", :clean_text=>"you will also find out new things every time you view it.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>10, :text=>"For  instance, the gun on Butch's counter didn't belong to Vincent, it belonged  to Wallace.", :clean_text=>"for instance the gun on butch's counter didn't belong to vincent it belonged to wallace.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>["Bruce Willis"], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>11, :text=>"Remember, Jules had already quit.", :clean_text=>"remember jules had already quit.", :sentiment=>-1, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>["Samuel L.

Pulp Fiction not only attracts our attention, it demands it. Much credit must be given to director Quentin Tarantino who co-authored the Academy Award winning best original screenplay with Roger Avary. The influences on his development as a filmmaker are too  numerous to list here but it is worth noting that Orson Welles, Daffy Duck, Akiro Kurosawa, Dashiell Hammett, Spike Lee, and Francois Truffaut would be on it. Many believe that this film saved John Travolta's career. His portrayal of the dangerous but somewhat dimwitted hit man, Vincent Vega,  is brilliant. In fact,  Tarantino assembled an outstanding cast and somehow coordinated the various plots in which they are involved. Destinies intersect, sometimes causing violent collisions. The film's accelerated pace, however, does not preclude \"eye of the hurricane\" moments as when Vincent dances with Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) in a nightclub or when Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) and Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) are held against their will by a psychopath. Tarantino has a very traditional view of film making: He wants vivid PICTURES and he wants them to MOVE. He also cherishes effective use of language, almost to the point that some scenes seem \"talky.\" My guess (only a guess) is that because Tarantino seems to be a compulsive conversationalist, he and members of his cast and crew never stopped talking about Pulp Fiction from the beginning to the end of its production and that many of them are still discussing it nine years after it was first released.This is a nasty, sometimes violent, occasionally hilarious, but never dull film. To those seeing it for the first time who almost immediately become uncomfortable, my advice is to be patient and allow the narrative to continue. You may end up being repulsed. Fair enough. But you may also find yourself enjoying what is deliberately and pre-eminently an unorthodox examination of how MOVING PICTURES can tell a story with compelling impact. For me, the vivid images and my emotional reactions to them dominate the literate, at times loopy dialogue.

Their dialogue\nis witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes\nthese two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you\nmight assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to\nwork. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which\nthey use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk\nhas no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that\nmatter. Yet without such scenes, \"Pulp Fiction\" wouldn't be \"Pulp\nFiction.\" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever\nstruck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent\nbut wonderfully textured.It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the\nsuitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably\nintended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many\nastonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first\nviewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But\nthere is no deeper explanation. \"Pulp Fiction,\" is, as the title\nindicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a\nbrilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other\nfilms, it is like a great work of abstract art, or \"art about art.\" It\nhas all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine\nwriting, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the\nmost well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what\nend? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything\nbut itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's\nessentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the\nthree main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form\nthe subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes\nwrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation\nto come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to\nabsurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to\nfocus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they\nmove the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions.\nIndeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character\never says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could\nhave simply told Yolanda, \"Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,\"\nwhich is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill\naction flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is\nlike. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a\npotential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with\nclever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they\nare full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of\nMia's statement to Vincent, \"That's when you know you've found somebody\nspecial: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and\ncomfortably enjoy the silence.\"What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a\nlot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who\nlooms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The\nwhole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite\nsection of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men\nwithout even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in\nways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced\nwith an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme\nalso helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film,\nits liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used\nas an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point\napplies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with\nrace. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance\nover weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in\npractice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a\nlevel of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding\ncitizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a\npatter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that\nVincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty.\nLater, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're\nnever sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral\nchoice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws\ncan act other than for self-preservation.Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these\neccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really \"about\"\nanything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about\nburgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it\ncontains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't\nneed to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a\nbetter job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind.\n*** This review may

In hindsight, however, it seems to\nme that while the movie must have definitely bowled them over, overall\nthey weren't sure exactly what to make of it or how to articulate what\nwere probably a confused mix of feelings. But I am so impressed that I\nfeel compelled to add a few specific observations to the many fine\nreviews already on this database.First, this movie hits you with an impact somewhere in between, say,\nAPOCALYPSE NOW and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and for some people may be just\nas disturbing (however, in this respect I am happy to report I didn't\nthink it rose to the level of NATURAL BORN KILLERS). Full of\ngraphically violent action and language, PULP FICTION is not a picture\nfor everyone - I would definitely not recommend it to my parents, born\nin the 1930's (even to my one fairly \"hip\" relative of the same\ngeneration who, at age 66, still teaches high school sex education and\nlikes to talk about things like sunbathing nude, among other\npotentially sensitive issues).Irrespective of audience sensibilities, however, the film-makers,\nsupported by superb acting in every role, manage to create a world full\nof the most fascinating sleazy characters possibly ever to appear on\nscreen. From Travolta's pronounced almost-child-like curiosity about\nthe world to Jackson's sincere and thoughtful philosophical ruminating\nand Willis's deep devotion to the memory of his father, I think such\nfascination lies not only in the characters' personalities as they are\nportrayed but in the way they tantalize the viewer into considering the\npossibility that such people could actually exist. As a lawyer of some\nyears' experience dealing with all sorts of people I was particularly\ndrawn to this aspect of the film.Thus, and in response to some other reviewers' comments, I think this\nmovie is more character-driven than plot-driven. Instead of a story\npeopled by basically weakly developed characters employed primarily as\na mere device to move the plot along, as is too frequently the case in\nthe movies (especially these days), the undeniably strong, clever, and\nunpredictable plot lines in PULP FICTION are actually of essentially\nsecondary interest and importance, serving primarily as vehicles to get\nyou worried about the fate of characters you can't help caring about\ndespite the truly low attributes that otherwise form the basis for\ntheir respective personas. As at least one other reviewer noted, when\nthe film ends you are actually disappointed, left craving more of these\ncrazy people and their explosive lives.Finally, and as strange as it may sound, this film reminds me of\nanother Monumentally Great Film which one would never typically\nassociate with it in any way in a million years - CASABLANCA. As in\nthat film made way back in 1942, and as another reviewer has suggested,\nperhaps its special appeal - its unusually high degree of emotional\nimpact - lies in its distinctly successful simultaneous application of\nseveral different genres in a single film - drama, action, dark humor -\nwith the whole thing bound together by essentially flawless execution\nin every department.

Then, by\npopulating the cast with an intriguing hand-picked array of actors to\ndeliver those well-written snappy lines.

It is only after watching the entirety of the\nmovie, and reflecting back on it, does the gestalt emerge for the\nviewer. And, it may take more than one viewing to get there. Then,\nlastly, by topping it all off with a snazzy soundtrack. That's how. Add\nall that stuff together and you get Pulp Fiction.The film received its share of acclaim, and deservedly so. But that\nsaid, while seen by most as a good film, Pulp Fiction is not regarded\nas another Citizen Kane, and Pulp Fiction is not ensconced in the\npantheon of the greatest of the great Hollywood films of all time.\nThose are for a reason. As good a cinematic achievement as Pulp Fiction\nis, the fact is that as a film it plows turf that's just way too coarse\nfor comfort. Over-the-top blood, guts, and brains-blown-out violence.\nGritty gutter language. Subject matter dwelling in the underbelly of\nlife that goes way beyond seedy or unseemly. And it's all presented in\na very graphic way. Some people really like it that way. Hey, I\nunderstand. That's what Tarantino wanted too, right? But the simple\nfact is that such fare isn't for everyone. Period. In this way its own\nintentional and unrelenting coarse nature is what self-selects it out\nof the greatness category.

And Pulp\nFiction of course certainly wasn't his last film. The Kill Bills, Vol.\nI and Vol. II, 2003 and 2004 respectively, were noteworthy and\nambitious projects. And Jackie Brown (1997) made its mark too. But\nlet's be honest here. When it comes to Tarantino it looks more and more\nlike Pulp Fiction is as good as it gets. And he hasn't moved much\nbeyond dwelling on the coarseness in any appreciable way. In fact, he's\nstill earnestly tilling that soil. And getting less and less out of it\ntoo, if Grindhouse (2007) is any measure (and most will say it is a\nmeasure). Of course at his age he has the potential of many more films\nin him screaming to get out, but unless he evolves in some new\ndirections, unless he stretches himself in some new and different ways\nas a storyteller, Pulp Fiction may end up being his magnum opus.

:content=>"\"Just because you are a character doesn't mean that you have character\"By the time that Quentin Tarantino's sophomore effort  reached us in 1994, he had already been heralded as the new wunderkind of American cinema. His debut Reservoir Dogs recaptured the magic of the heist thriller and his screenplay to the bold and brilliant True Romance opened up a real desire to see more of his fast-talking low life's. Pulp Fiction is no different and is now widely considered a cinematic classic. It received 7 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Director and one for each of it's leading trio of actors in Travolta, Thurman and Jackson. It walked away with the Best Screenplay award and it won the coveted Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. On this evidence alone, it's hard to argue that Tarantino not only delivered on, but surpassed, his early promise.In L.A.'s criminal underworld, the lives and stories of the inhabitants intertwine. There are two hitmen with very different outlooks, a boxer forced to take a dive for the money, a gangster's moll who likes to dance and do drugs and many others who play a part in shaping their redemptive paths.\"...a shapeless mass of matter\" or \"a magazine or book containing lurid subject matter...\". These are the definitions of the word \"Pulp\" which we are provided with before the film even begins. As a result, Tarantino's masterpiece is self-referential from the opening title card. What follows is only proof of his intentions to recreate the trashy and hardboiled pulp novels of the early 20th century. Even the film's poster reflects the sensational cover art of these novels and it's this attention to detail that's often overlooked in Tarantino's homage to a bygone age. I suppose it's understandable that these details are overlooked considering Tarantino's highly stylish approach. He employs his (now common) nonlinear storylines and chapters, his abundantly original cast of characters and his dialogue has rarely been sharper. Quite honestly, he takes great pride in making pop-cultural references but the film itself has nowhere red the very pop-culture it revels in. To this day, it's endlessly quoted and few, if any, will ever frown at you inquisitively if you were to make a Pulp Fiction reference.It's not just the one-liners, the observant monologues or the endless back and forth, intelligent and philosophical discussions between the characters, it's the fact that snippets of dialogue actually matter in terms of the overall structure. Something can be flippantly mentioned one minute only for it to resurface with relevance at a later part in the film. Ultimately, it's the dialogue that brings every strand together and it's, quite simply, masterfully assembled. To embody his colourful characters, Tarantino assembles his most impressive cast yet. Considering his relative obscurity at the time, it was a bit of a gamble to have John Travolta headline the whole affair as hitman Vincent Vega (the brother of Michael Madsen's Vic Vega from Reservoir Dogs) but I don't think I'd be alone in saying that it was a welcome return to scintillating form. Uma Thurman also impresses as Mia, the coke snorting gangster's moll who seems ill at ease with all the violence and whispers that surround her no-nonsense kingpin husband Marsellus Wallace (a brilliant Ving Rhames). Even the limited acting skills of Bruce Willis are all but forgotten as the self-important, ageing pugilist, Butch Coolidge (a role originally offered to Mickey Rourke and Matt Dillon) but the real prize possession would have to be Samuel L. Jackson's Jules Winnfield, Vincent's unhinged partner who likes to quote passages from the bible and believes in divine intervention. There are so many great performances that it's hard to mention them all. From top to bottom, the whole cast bring Tarantino's dialogue to life; from the aforementioned main performers to the supporting likes of Christopher Walken's Captain Koons who hid an uncomfortable watch \"up his ass\" for 2 years to Zed and Maynard - Peter Greene and Duane Whitaker's white trash who like to \"bring out the gimp\" and sodomise their captives. There's even a character who only gets mentioned by name but still makes an impression:  Antwone Rockamora, brilliantly nicknamed \"Tony Rocky Horror\" who's mentioned in an unforgettable, lengthy discussion on the sexual implications of massaging a woman's feet and whether it's in the same ballpark as \"sticking your tongue in the holiest of the holies\". So iconic are these characters and blackly comic dialogue that most will know exactly what I'm talking about without me having to elaborate and therein lies the sheer joy and richness of the film.From illuminated McGuffins to Big Kahuna Burgers, Pulp Fiction is one of a kind. It redefined the crime film with it's emphasis on cool and endlessly quotable dialogue and there's so much attention to characterisation that Tarantino could have made several films from his material. Watching \"a bunch of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangster shit\" has never been more enjoyable.

The first time I saw this I was 17 years old and asked my parents what \"Reservoir Dogs\" was about because I heard that the \"Du Hast\" video by Rammstein was based on that movie.  They told me about it, and it sounded amazing.  So I went up to broadway video(only Paris people will remember that glorious video store) and rented \"Dogs\" and \"Pulp Fiction\" on VHS. I didn't know if I would watch \"Fiction\" or not, but I saw the same guy directed both, so I figured I would check it out just in case.  I watched \"Dogs\" and was in love and as soon as it ended I popped \"Fiction\" in.  From the opening scene I knew I was watching something special, something amazing, and a movie that I would never forget.  I watched it again the next day(something I rarely ever do), and then a few days later I bought them both on DVD(all I had was a PS2 and didn't use it very much).  I have watched \"Fiction\" countless times since and have the entire movie basically memorized.  I've boughtt it again on a 2 disc DVD and then last year I bout it on blu ray.  Last night was the first time I got around to watching it on Blu Ray, and my god the movie pops and comes to life like I hadn't seen.  From the color of Vincent's car to the sweat on Jules head it just make this feel like a new movie.  It had been a couple years since I just sat down and watched this all the way through, and the movie still feels insanely fresh, innovative, and special.  I was still on the edge when Mia gets her adrenaline shot.  I was still shocked when Zed brings out the gimp and I still laughed at how crazy Honey Bunny gets after being so damn sweet. This movie is an extreme movie as you either love it or hate it(I know people that are on both sides), and I absolutely love it.  If rotten tomatoes would let me I'd give it 10 stars, because no other movie comes close to giving the amazing experience that \"Pulp Fiction\" is able to give.  I've introduced this movie to quite a few people and it's a movie that when Grant comes of age, I can't wait to show him.  If you have never seen this, this I strongly, strongly recommend you rent/download/borrow a copy, set aside 3 hours and just prepare to get your mind blown.  If you have seen this, this go back and watch again.

Since its release in 1994, the film has become nothing short of legendary; some may feel its praise from hipsters and venerable critics alike is undue, but I don't think it is. The film's non-linear narrative is so strong, so rich; it keeps you thoroughly engaged and develops the characters in such a way that you begin to run through your head the chronology of the characters' stories, making sense of Tarantino's and Avary's complex script. This complexity makes 'Pulp Fiction' endlessly re-watchable, I have seen it many times, and recently I was lucky enough to catch a screening at the Duke of York's Picturehouse in Brighton, which was an experience that reminded me of how special this film is.  \r\r'Pulp Fiction' explores the following principal characters: Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, a pair of loquacious hitmen who appear to exist in a style vacuum; Butch Coolidge, an aging but courageous prize fighter; Marcellus Wallace, a seemingly omnipotent mobster and Mia Wallace, the flirtatious wife of Mr. Wallace whom Vincent Vega is assigned to take out to dinner. The characters' stories famously clash with each other, regularly to chaotic and hilarious effect.\rTarantino is yet to return to this kind of form. \r\rAfter 'Jackie Brown' in 1998, he spent time making the entertaining but comparably meagre 'Kill Bill' films, which were well orchestrated viscera, but ultimately below him. He then made 'Death Proof', which was an offensively bad, juvenile piece of work with a script of unprecedented annoyance. However, Tarantino made a comeback with 'Inglourious Basterds', which had a rather appealing premise and many memorable scenes. 2013 sees the launch of 'Django Unchained', which, with its ensemble cast and inevitable flair, is one of the most exciting films of the year. \r\r'Pulp Fiction' has all the components of a classic, it has the scope and the quality, it is within the bracket of films such as 'The Godfather', 'Goodfellas' and 'Citizen Kane', films that will be revisited by audiences forever, films that are firmly considered as 'required viewing'.", :title=>nil, :location=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"rotten_tomatoes", :url=>"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pulp_fiction/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"'Pulp Fiction' is a film with not a flaw worth mentioning, if there are any, that is.", :clean_text=>"'pulp fiction is a film with not a flaw worth mentioning if there are any that is.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"Since its release in 1994, the film has become nothing short of legendary; some may feel its praise from hipsters and venerable critics alike is undue, but I don't think it is.", :clean_text=>"since its release in 1994 the film has become nothing short of legendary some may feel its praise from hipsters and venerable critics alike is undue but i don't think it is.", :sentiment=>1, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>2, :text=>"The film's non-linear narrative is so strong, so rich; it keeps you thoroughly engaged and develops the characters in such a way that you begin to run through your head the chronology of the characters' stories, making sense of Tarantino's and Avary's complex script.", :clean_text=>"the film's non-linear narrative is so strong so rich it keeps you thoroughly engaged and develops the characters in such a way that you begin to run through your head the chronology of the characters stories making sense of tarantino's and avary's complex script.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{:plot=>65, :dialog=>50}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>3, :text=>"This complexity makes 'Pulp Fiction' endlessly re-watchable, I have seen it many times, and recently I was lucky enough to catch a screening at the Duke of York's Picturehouse in Brighton, which was an experience that reminded me of how special this film is.", :clean_text=>"this complexity makes pulp fiction endlessly re-watchable i have seen it many times and recently i was lucky enough to catch a screening at the duke of york's picturehouse in brighton which was an experience that reminded me of how special this film is.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>4, :text=>"'Pulp Fiction' explores the following principal characters: Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, a pair of loquacious hitmen who appear to exist in a style vacuum; Butch Coolidge, an aging but courageous prize fighter; Marcellus Wallace, a seemingly omnipotent mobster and Mia Wallace, the flirtatious wife of Mr. Wallace whom Vincent Vega is assigned to take out to dinner.", :clean_text=>"'pulp fiction explores the following principal characters vincent vega and jules winnfield a pair of loquacious hitmen who appear to exist in a style vacuum butch coolidge an aging but courageous prize fighter marcellus wallace a seemingly omnipotent mobster and mia wallace the flirtatious wife of mr wallace whom vincent vega is assigned to take out to dinner.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{:plot=>50}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>["John Travolta", "Samuel L.

From the outset, Leone makes it clear that his focus on portraying the life and environment of the West would supersede any need to tell the story. His self appointed task of showing all the mundane happenings andAn epic about the expansion and construction as the frontier pushed toward the pacific, interlined with one man's journey to make someone pay for what he did in the past. From the outset, Leone makes it clear that his focus on portraying the life and environment of the West would supersede any need to tell the story. His self appointed task of showing all the mundane happenings and goings on of this world is well achieved. A train station is shown where the typical protagonist of a Western, who never has a name, engages himself in a shoot-out while in search for a man named Frank. Focus shifts to McBain and his family who owns a land in the middle of nowhere. He is clearly suspicious about something that is going to happen and we are rewarded with what it is almost immediately. During this conflict we are introduced to this Frank that the first man was searching for. A woman enters the story right around here who becomes more involved in the plot as the movie progresses, so is another character by the name of Cheyenne. She suddenly finds herself the centre of attention among outlaws and rail-road companies. The treatment of women is summed up quite clearly the way men behave with her. She is initially a woman who is well dressed and of a noble birth by all accounts and if even that could not gain her even the lowest level of respect, nothing could. The latter is the more engaging of any characters in the script, and thank God for his presence. As the plot thickens, the mysterious man looks for Frank, Cheyenne seeks to clear his name in an incident involving multiple killings, and Frank helps his partner acquire land in the path of the envisioned rail-road to the pacific. The first two decide to stick around and help Jill with something that would honour the memory of the man who was killed, while Frank does all he can to take the land he needs to build the rail-road. Frank asks the man twice who he is, to which he lists the names of some of the men he has killed. It is not enough that Frank should die. He needs to suffer while thinking about why this man wants to kill him. To this purpose he is even saved by this man. And surely enough, when Frank cannot take it any more, he himself goes after the man to find out the reason. At this point we finally learn the secret. I felt like the movie lost steam an hour and a half into it and after that it felt like a task just to finish watching it. It was a narrative mess. The Man has every intention to come across as mysterious and awe-inspiring, but I found it frustrating after a while. He seemed to be content with wasting other people's (including the audience) time. I found Cheyenne much more interesting. The dialogue was sparse. Only Cheyenne knew how to say things that would make people laugh and keep humoured, which was essential given the length of the movie. The plot develops linearly but Leone decided that it wasn't doing it for him and jumbled up everything. Some plot jumps took place, one of which infuriated me the most. The cinematography captured the bleak landscape of the West. The score was slow paced and introduced tension during the key moments. The set design depicted the life at the frontier with the wooden towns, horse-drawn carriages, sweaty people, all that. Considered the greatest of Leone's work, I could not agree in good conscience. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly was a hell of a lot more fun and had engaging characters, even though it had a fraction of the budget for this movie, proving once again that great movies need not be created through extravagance. Here, the characters seemed bland for the most part. They seemed not to know where they had to move in service to the story and wandered around aimlessly. There was not a single scene that cut it out for me. The only thing that Once did better was portray the daily life and toil of ordinary people in the west. The movie failed to make a major impact on my emotions and senses right until the last shoot-out, which speaks for Leone's idea of greatness_ bore people so much that they have to see the timer several times to make sure the movie is headed forward. While it can be argued that the movie depicted the general life in the west quite effectively, I for one feel that story always trumps the need for grand style and an urge to make some kind of a statement. There's no doubt that the setting needs to be strong, but the characters need to be much stronger, which in turn should give way to the plot.", :useful=>[0.0, 0], :username=>"Swati", :date=>"Dec 30, 2013", :location=>nil, :title=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"metacritic", :url=>"http://www.metacritic.com/movie/once-upon-a-time-in-the-west/user-reviews"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"An epic about the expansion and construction as the frontier pushed toward the pacific, interlined with one man's journey to make someone pay for what he did in the past.

Finally, MGM has given Sergio Leone's Western epic the double-disc special edition it deserves. The print is restored and as clear as I've ever seen it, the sound is now an astonishing 5.1 Surround (listen to the glass falling off Tuco after he springs through the window in the opening sequence!) nineteen minutes of footage from the Italian original have been restored, and the discs are packed with extras. Even the packaging is great: a sturdy interlocking box, with the DVDs kept in the upper and bottom parts of the two lids. Also inside the box are cards containing posters for the film in five different countries.The film, like most of the European Westerns of the 1960s, was critically disregarded in its day. The New York Times said of it: \"the most expensive, pious, and repellent movie in the history of its peculiar genre. There is scarcely a moment's respite from the pain.\" It's amazing how people missed the brilliance of this movie, which turned Western conventions upside down in such a wonderfully bizarre, European way. Now the film is considered a classic, and only Sergio Leone's own \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (another great 2 DVD set, by the way) has more respect in the genre. Leone's strange style -- stretched out time, obsession with close-ups and extreme wide-shots, focus on rituals, and use of Morricone's wild and avant-garde score -- are all in full force in this tale of three treasure-seekers searching for a cache of gold coins on the Texas-New Mexico border during the Civil War. The implacable and unflappable 'hero' Blondie (Clint Eastwood), the crazy comic bandit Tuco (Eli Wallach), and the calculating immoral sadist Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) cross each other's paths amidst the senseless violence of the war. Leone perfectly contrasts the self-interested men with the greater backdrop of the tragedy of war. It's a strangely emotionally affecting picture despite its focus on three men who are detached from normal society and seem not to care about anything but money.  So many individual scenes stand out for their virtuosity that the movie a parade of \"greatest hits.\" Most astonishing of all is \"The Ecstasy of Gold\" sequence where Tuco dashes madly through a cemetery, looking for the grave that might hold the gold. Morricone's music here is especially overwhelming.Chances are you've seen the film and love it. What about the new scenes and the extras?Nineteen minutes of footage have been restored that were never shown in the American prints. The scenes integrate perfectly into the film, and after seeing them once, you won't be able to imagine they were ever missing. Among the scenes are Angel Eyes visiting a destroyed fort; Tuco hiring bandits to help him chase Blondie; Blondie and Angel Eyes having a face-to-face when they first set out together to find the gold; and some extra conversation between Tuco and Blondie in the desert. However, these scenes were never dubbed into English in the 1960s. Therefore, the DVD producers had to newly dub them. Eli Wallach and Clint Eastwood do their own voices. An actor named Simon Prescott does the imitation of the deceased Lee Van Cleef. Admittedly, Wallach and Eastwood no longer sound the same, but I couldn't imagine someone else imitating their voices -- it couldn't have been done any other way. Prescott is pretty good as Angel Eyes, if a bit more gravelly.The extras...Disc 1 has audio commentary by Richard Shickel, a film historian who wrote Eastwood's biography and also did commentary on Leone's \"Once Upon a Time in America\" DVD. His comments can be pretty dry, and he focuses mostly on Leone's style and techniques instead of on background information on the filming itself. Nonetheless, there are many interesting insights, and Shickel manages to say a lot during the three-hour running time.Most of the extras are on Disc 2:\"Leone's West\" -- A 20-minute documentary about the making of the film. Includes interviews with Shickel, producer Alberto Grimaldi, author of the English dialogue Mickey Knox, and best of all, Eastwood and Wallach. There's some very interesting info and memories here, mostly from Knox and the two actors.\"The Leone Style\" -- A 23-minute documentary, really just an extension of the first one. It spends more time on Leone's unusual techniques. The same interviewees appear here.\"The Man Who Lost the Civil War\" -- A 14-minute documentary that was produced separately from the DVD. It makes no mention of the movie, but is about its historical backdrop: the disastrous General Sibley campaign in Texas. Sibley appears in the film briefly, and this short documentary gives the viewer an important insight into the world of Blondie, Tuco, and Angel Eyes.\"Reconstructing The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" -- An 11 minute look into the painstaking work involved with fixing the picture and sound, restoring the cut scenes, and re-dubbing it.\"Il Maestro: Ennio Morricone\" -- 8 minutes; mostly an interview with music scholar John Burlingame about the film's score. At the end of the feature, you can choose to listen to an audio-only twelve-minute lecture by Burlingame that provides a much more in-depth analysis of the music.\"Deleted Scenes\" -- Two scenes couldn't go back into the film. The extended torture scene had a damaged negative, so here it is in its rougher state. An apparently lost scene is reconstructed through text, stills, and clips from the French trailer.Finally, there's a gallery of posters, the original trailer, and MGM tossing in some gratuitous advertising for their other films.Don't miss this DVD.

The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a fantastic entry in his oeuvre (though I rank Once Upon A Time in the West and For A Few Dollars More just above it). It is full of his great style, it's very entertaining, and it features one of the best adversarial trios ever put to film in Blondie, Tuco, and Angel Eyes.So it is with sadness that I have to rate this Blu-Ray 3 stars (and it's closer to 2.5). I've bought this movie three times now, not counting this Blu-Ray: on VHS, the first single disc DVD, and the SE that came out a few years ago. It should be obvious that I love this movie. When the Blu-Ray was announced, I was ecstatic. High definition Leone? Sign me up! I pre-ordered it along with the new T2 disc. Then I started reading early reviews that said the picture quality wasn't up to snuff. I was disheartened, and decided to cancel my order until I could check out the disc for myself.I rented it from Netflix, and have unfortunately found my fears confirmed. While it certainly looks better than the SE DVD, it is not the best this movie can look. The over-zealous Digital Noise Reduction that has been applied completely robs many scenes of the fine detail we might otherwise have seen in 1080p. I put the old SE DVD in my Xbox and flipped back and forth between the Blu-Ray and DVD on a single scene (Blondie stands alone against some hills in the background in the final scene). While the Blu-Ray looked \"cleaner\" (that is, the digital artifacting visible on the DVD was gone), there was actually no further detail to be seen on the Blu-Ray! It was as if you took the DVD image and smeared it until the noise was gone, then bumped it up to 1080. I looked specifically at Blondie's eyes to see if any more detail was visible on the Blu-Ray, but there wasn't. The bushes on the hill in the background, too, looked like sharpened up-scaled blobs rather than bushes captured on film by a camera.So, the picture quality isn't as good, but how about the rest? Well, it's mostly great! The extras, carried over from the SE, are all still interesting, and the new commentaries (which I haven't listened to yet) are very welcome and appreciated. The new menus are also nice. But I do have one more negative point: the sound.If you watch the special feature on restoring the movie, the producer notes that in order to make a 5.1 audio track, he had to add sound effects. While I'm sure some appreciate having a 5.1 track, the sound effects (specifically the gun-shots) sound way off from the original unique and integral Leone effects. They use the exact same stock gun-shot that you've heard on TV cop shows and it really detracts from the movie if you've seen the original as many times as I have. The Blu-Ray includes many audio options, but unfortunately, an original mono track is not among them. It did have an English 2.0 mono, but it's still the remastered sound with the lame gun-shot effects, oddly. To hear the difference, pick a scene (like Tuco in the bath), and switch back and forth between the English 5.1 or 2.0 and the Italian 2.0. It's very obvious and really bugs me. So if I want to hear the original sound effects, I have to watch it in Italian? Come on, MGM/Fox, how hard would it have been to include the ORIGINAL 2.0 Mono track?So, in conclusion, you have a great movie on Blu-Ray with lackluster picture and no original English soundtrack, but a plethora of great extras, all on a single disc. Worth it? Not for me, but it may be for you. I'm holding out hope that one day MGM/Fox will get a good transfer that isn't overly digitally tampered with (Leone should have some GRAIN, man! Check out the Italian BR releases!), and includes the original mono sound in English.

While it is part of his Spaghetti Western Trilogy( all three films have different characters and plots), the film stands on its own and really shows you how good a movie can really be.  This movie has it all.  It has action, drama and even some comic relief in it.  It is a timeless classic that is unforgettable.  When I first saw it, I was a little kid and couldn't truly appreciate it as I can now at age 22.Blondie (The Man with No Name) isn't your typical good guy.  He mainly does things that suits his own agenda.  However, when compared to the murderous Angel Eyes and the greedy Tuco, Blondie is a saint.  This tale involves bloodshed, shoot-outs, search for treasure, and double-crossing.  And it all takes place while the Civil War is going on, which makes things a lot more \"interesting\" for the notorious three.  The West has never been wilder or more unpredictable than it is now.  With an incredible score, excellent acting, and superb story-telling, this is one memorable film that you will never forget.As I said in the beginning, the first time I saw this was when I was a little kid.  When I just recently purchased this new edition of the movie, it truly was like I was watching it for the first time.  Coming from a guy who isn't a big fan of Westerns (I don't mind them, but I don't watch too many of them), I absolutely LOVED this film.  In fact, I wanted to give it a standing ovation when it was all said and done due to how moved I was by it.  This really is filmmaking at its finest.  I wasn't terribly impressed with Leone's \"Once Upon a Time in America,\" but he is absolutely flawless with this amazing and timeless Western.  It is slower than the second film (\"For a Few Dollars More\"), but I think that makes this all the better.  The build up of tension is much more present in this film, and you really get the sense that these characters are real people.  Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach are brilliant in their roles, and a lot of props need to go to Lee Van Cleef as he is absolutely chilling in his role.This new edition really does the film the justice it deserves.  The film has been restored to the director's original vision as much as possible, giving you an extra 18 minutes.  You will notice the added scenes as the voices have been re-dubbed (the first time you will notice this will throw you, as I think that specific part has the worst re-dubbing, but the other added scenes are done a lot better, even if you still notice it).  The picture looks incredible and the sound is great.  Extras included are commentary from Richard Schickel, a couple of documentaries and featurettes, poster gallery, deleted scenes and the original theatrical trailer.  Along with the nice packaging, you get an 8-page booklet that includes pictures from the film along with Roger Ebert's most recent review of the film.  And, you get some mini-posters included inside the packaging as well.  A superior edition of the movie, without question.\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" is a pure triumph in filmmaking and should be seen by everybody at least once.  Don't let the fact that this is a Western throw you.  I think this can be enjoyed by everybody, and even by those who are not big fans of Westerns.  A film filled with authentic emotion and action, this is one that shouldn't be missed by anyone.  I LOVE this movie, and I cannot express that enough. -Michael Crane", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[105, 118], :date=>" 2004 July 16", :title=>"\"Such ingratitude after all the times I

Three men whose lives cross when the search for confederate money leads them through the war torn west of the Amercian Civil War. Clint Eastwood (Blondie/man with no name), Lee Van Cleef (Angel Eyes) and Eli Wallach (Tuco) are the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly respectively, each with their own agenda to get to a cemetary and a certain grave holding dirty loot. Sergio Leone's direction can be compared to the european comics of the time in which the movie screen, like comic strip panels, have close-ups of the characters with sweeping backgrounds.  The DVD widescreen format restores Leone's great camera work and sense of composition. When shown on regular tv, the viewer gets an old or bad print of the film in pan and scan format and all that great compostion is lost. The score and theme song by Ennio Morricone is legendary and familiar and the characters are sweaty, dirty, and real. Its amazing that the story takes place in the American Civil War west, but it was actually filmed in the deserts of Spain. Clint Eastwood's man with no name is as cool and macho as ever, but Eli Wallach's role as the wanted bandit, \"Tuco\" is the standout character and he should have won an Oscar for that performance.  The DVD has a trailer and interesting liner notes, but one wishes an actor or director commentary.  Perhaps a special edition DVD will someday be released.

An audacious undertaking, it would have flopped miserably in any other director's hands. Only someone so commited to his artistic vision as Leone could have pulled off this bombastic pageantry of human nature in all its facets, its capacity for cynicism, greed, bloodlust, revenge, heroism, redemption and honour.This movie must be *experienced.* Put the DVD in, turn the stereo all the way up and let it pummel you from the moment the Lardani titles blast onto the screen in a blaze of Technicolor fury. The montage of colour, interspersed by stark black and white visages of Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach is a tough act to follow, like Saul Bass' mesmerising titles for Hitchcock's \"Vertigo.\"The wait is now over! Last year, MGM/UA issued a restored 35mm print, which showed at the Film Forum in Manhattan. First restored in Italian by Cineteca Nazionale, the English-language restoration was spearheaded by Martin Scorsese, whose efforts with the Film Preservation Foundation have helped fund preservation of America's celluloid heritage. Both Eli Wallach and Clint Eastwood returned to the sound studio to dub new dialogue for approximately 20 minutes of restored footage. Both sound a little older and scratchier, but these added scenes help to explain both Tuco's and Angel Eyes' gangs and some plot points that were previously unclear. However, they both sound great! (Van Cleef's voice was dubbed by a professional voiceover artist, and sounds almost on target). The movie now has the true feel of a sprawling epic, one that's earned its right to take its time.This special edition DVD features the movie restored to its original length in the Italian version, and comes jam packed with interviews with Eastwood, Wallach, producer Alberto Grimaldi and -- most importantly -- Mickey Knox, who wrote the English language dialogue. Knox crafted lines that lived up to the larger than life screenplay. You'd swear the original was in English, the dialogue is so perfectly tailored!But the vision is singularly Leone's. It starts slowly, as  a band of bounty killers home in on their prey, small-time bandit Tuco Ramirez (THE UGLY, played by the venerable Eli Wallach). They pile through a saloon door, then the camera imediately pans away laterally. Suddenly, his body hurtling through the front window in a rain of glass, Tuco bursts onto the street -- in what has to be the most absurd grand entrance in screen history -- revolver in one hand, a chicken leg in the other. It's total chutzpah on Leone's and Wallach's part.If you think *that* can't be topped, watch Wallach's entire performance. Animated is putting it mildly. More than a performance, Wallach is a one-man band, nay, Army. Never has such a selfish, petty, ratty and shifty little man been played so larger than life. Wallach smirks, scurries, grimaces, chuckles, shouts, bellows and slyly oils his way across the screen in what has got to be the hammiest performance ever by a method actor. Or *any* actor: He makes Orson Welles, Burt Lancaster and Charles Laughton look like the grey and sullen cast of Woody Allen's \"Interiors,\" he's so alive with passion that he literally sweats his performance out through the filthy pores on his stubble-ridden face. And he's wonderful!If that's a tough act to follow, you haven't met the bad. They don't come any badder than Angel Eyes, Lee Van Cleef's hired killer who's got ice water running through his veins. Van Cleef is ruthless, bold and heartless. Riding out of nowhere onto a doomed man's rancho, Angel Eyes pays a visit, carrying out a murder for hire. The price: $500. But the victim offers him $1000 to look the other way. No dice: Angel Eyes isn't in it for the money. Rather, he's a man who loves his work, and always sees the job through. So, the poor sod dies anyway.Clint Eastwood is as cool as a cucumber as The Man With No Name (but really one with sort of a name, in this case \"Blondie,\" which is Wallach's moniker for him). It's fun watching the ongoing relationship between Blondie and Tuco as bounty hunter and prey. In another life, they would have been great pals, but in this life (\"we're all alone in this world,\" Tuco confesses to Blondie, half seriously, half cynically) their love of money is thicker than friendship. So, they invent ingenious and cruel ways to exact revenge of each other.It's during one of Tuco's sadistic plots - in which he marches the pale-skinned Eastwood across 100 miles of scorching desert - that the plot finally comes to a head: A driverless stagecoach full of wounded Confederates happens across their path, and through a twist of fate, Tuco and Blondie each have two halves of a secret which, if put together, will make them a quarter of a million dollars richer. But, without each other the two halves are worthless. Thus does Tuco do a 180 from brutal executioner to Blondie's would-be saviour. Now that he could be rich, he suddenly realizes how valuable their friendship is.It's not before long that they wind up with Angel Eyes, as they're captured by Union soldiers. At the prisoner of war camp, a deadly game of cat and mouse begins. Van Cleef is now more restrained and less thuggish as he deals with Tuco to extract the secret; his henchman Wallace (Mario Brega, a Leone stalwart), pummels it out of Tuco.In epic fashion, after a shootout in a deserted town and a bridge demolition that explodes across the screen, Tuco, Blondie and Angel Eyes make their way to the cemetery where the treasure is buried. In a fanfare of brass, percussion and chorus, the three face each other down in the cemetery plaza. It's a gorgeous and cathartic set piece. Credit must go not only to composer Ennio Morricone but also to musical director Bruno Nicolai, who conducts the score con fuoco.", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[11, 12], :date=>" 2004

In a way, it's a morality play, weighing the consequences of\ngood and evil, but it does so in a realistic manner.  Sometimes, crime does\npay, at least in the short term, and sometimes good does go unrewarded. \nThis film probably signaled the death knell of the traditional John Wayne\n`White Hat/Black Hat' Western.The three main characters make the film.  Lee Van Cleef (`The Bad') is evil\npersonified.  Totally ruthless, he'll do whatever it takes to get what he\nwants.  Clint Eastwood (`The Good') is the Man With No Name, not really\n`good' in a traditional sense . . . but he has a certain sense of honor and\ntries to do the right thing.  (Watch the scene when he gives a dying\nConfederate soldier a puff of his cigar - powerful, and it sums up\neverything that the Man With No Name is all about, without saying a single\nword.)  Eli Wallach (`The Ugly') is Tuco, and he's easily the most complex -\nif not the best - character in the film.  All impulse and rage, Tuco spins\nwildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be Clint\nEastwood's best friend in one scene, trying to kill him in another - Tuco\ntruly represents `the ugly' side of people.The movie is long, but there's not a wasted scene in the film.  Each one\nslowly lets the film unfold with a certain style and grace, revealing more\nabout each character and what's going on.  The pacing is incredible, as is\nthe direction - Sergio Leone manages to build a lot of uncomfortable tension\nin the film, keeping the film from ever getting predictable.  Any typical\nWestern cliché that you can possibly think of is either given a unique twist\nor utterly destroyed by Leone's masterful storytelling.  Of special mention\nis Ennio Morricone's score, which is absolutely perfect.  Two scenes - one\nin a Union prison camp, one in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the\nend of the film - are amazing on their own, but they become absolutely\nastonishing with combined with Morricone's powerful score. This movie is absolutely brilliant.  If you haven't seen it yet, I strongly\nurge to do so.  Immediately.

It is ironic that, at the time the three Sergio Leone\nwesterns were released, they were largely panned by critics as being\npoor and even laughable imitations of American-made westerns. The fact\nthat they were filmed in Italy and Spain resulted in them receiving\ntheir amusing nickname which was intended to degrade them at the time.Somehow, over the quarter century or so since their release, the\ncritics have tended to change their opinions, and now these movies are\ngenerally regarded as classics. Perhaps this is because Clint Eastwood\nwas principally known only as the second banana, Rowdy Yates, in the\ntelevision series \"Rawhide\" when the films were produced but since then\nhas achieved superstardom. But I also think it goes beyond that. I\nbelieve the critics decided to take another look at these films and\nrealized that they had been premature in writing them off. Actually, I\nbelieve the three films were considerably better than most of what\nHollywood produced. In fact, I think that TGTBATU ranks among the best\nwesterns ever produced bringing to mind the magnificent films of John\nFord, the undisputed master of that genre, and his protege, the\nincomparable John Wayne. I have nothing but praise for this film. In fact, I rank it as one of\nmy favorite films of all time. I could write volumes of what is good\nabout this film. But since its qualities have been oft repeated in\nother viewer reviews, I will focus on what others didn't like about it.\nMost of the IMDb reviews had only one major complaint: the film is too\nlong. I disagree. In fact, in spite of its nearly three hour length, I\nwas disappointed that it ended. I was so absorbed in the film that I\nwas disheartened to have to return to reality. The combination of\nstory, cinematography, acting and musical score left nothing to be\ndesired other than more of the same! The sequences that seemed to drag\non in the opinion of other reviewers were necessary to fully create\nmoods and to drive home important points. For example, the opening\nsequence might be regarded as needlessly long as Angel Eyes taunts a\nhapless man over a leisurely meal. But to me, scenes like that are what\nmakes the movie great! The time allows the viewer to fully appreciate\nthe amazing replication of the primitive home and the pitiful life of\nits dirt-poor inhabitants. I felt as though I was sitting there at the\ntable; I was half tempted to reach for a bowl and spoon to partake of\nthe meal. And all the while the suspense was building towards the\ninevitable climax. You know it's coming but not when and the length of\nthe scene drives you crazy but makes it all the more satisfying when it\ndoes happen. Another example is when Tuco punishes Joe by forcing him to walk\nthrough the desert. This is possibly the only time that one might\nbecome bored with the film. But again, I think the time for the scene\nwas justified in that we are able to receive the full impact of that\nexperience and enjoy the haunting music at the same time. Joe's\nsubsequent predicament might not have had much credibility had this\nsequence been abbreviated. In my opinion, one of the essential elements of a great film is\ncreating moods that absorb our attention. This often takes time, lots\nof time. For example, many of the scenes in the magnificent film \"Dr.\nZhivago\" were almost painfully long but they were necessary to create\nthose startling surrealistic moods, and the film would not have been\ngreat without them. In many ways, TGTBATU has this same sort of\ngreatness. It is a sweeping epic with very compelling characters and\nmagnificent settings that draws the viewer in and doesn't release him\nuntil the closing credits begin to roll. When it's over, you feel that\nyou've been on a long and exciting journey. Such a journey takes time.In summary, if you haven't seen this film, buy it right away. Don't\nrent it because you will not want to part with it once you've seen it.Then curl up with it on a cold, rainy Sunday afternoon when you are in\nno hurry to do anything.\n\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060196/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"\n\nThis is the third,and arguably the best, of the so-called \"spaghetti\nwestern\" trilogy.", :clean_text=>"this is the third,and arguably the best of the so-called spaghetti western trilogy.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"It is ironic that, at the time the three Sergio Leone\nwesterns were released, they were largely panned by critics as being\npoor and even laughable imitations of American-made westerns.", :clean_text=>"it is ironic that at the time the three sergio leone westerns were released they were largely panned by critics as being poor and even laughable imitations of american-made westerns.", :sentiment=>-2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>["Sergio Leone"], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>2, :text=>"The fact\nthat they were filmed in Italy and Spain resulted in them receiving\ntheir amusing nickname which was intended to degrade them at the time.Somehow, over the quarter century or so since their release, the\ncritics have tended to change their opinions, and now these movies are\ngenerally regarded as classics.", :clean_text=>"the fact that they were filmed in italy and spain resulted in them receiving their amusing nickname which was intended to degrade them at the time.somehow over the quarter century or so since their release the critics have tended to change their opinions and now these movies are generally regarded as classics.", :sentiment=>-2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>3, :text=>"Perhaps this is because Clint Eastwood\nwas principally known only as the second banana, Rowdy Yates, in the\ntelevision series \"Rawhide\" when the films were produced but since then\nhas achieved superstardom.", :clean_text=>"perhaps this is because clint eastwood was principally known only as the second banana rowdy yates in the television series rawhide when the films were produced but since then has achieved superstardom.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>["Clint Eastwood"], :people_indexes=>[["Clint Eastwood", [[24]]]]}, {:index=>4, :text=>"But I also think it goes beyond that.", :clean_text=>"but i also think it goes beyond that.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>5, :text=>"I\nbelieve the critics decided to take another look at these films and\nrealized that they had been premature in writing them off.

You've got men carrying revolvers that look like\nold style cap-and-ball pistols, but they're loading them with metallic\ncartridges- historically about five years early. Eastwood carries a rifle\nthat hasn't been invented yet, Tuco assembles a \"superpistol\" out of a\nColt,\na Remington, and a Smith and Wesson- impossible. And there was nothing of\nmerit taking place between the North and South during the Civil War in the\nSouthwest.\nNow, that aside, I must say that this is the Greatest western ever. I\nfirst\nsaw this film when I was about ten. I'd never sat through an entire\nWestern\nbefor, even though my Dad watched them constantly. Since then, I've been\nthrough film school, watched hundreds of Westerns, learned to appreciate\nthem- but NOTHING matches up to this. The Searchers, Stagecoach, Gunfight\nat\nthe O.K. Corral, The Gunfighter, High Noon, Shane- all great films, but\nsaddled with the standard American Western morality- the good guy never\ntakes liberties with the eastern schoolmarm, the bad guy wears a black\nhat,\netc. Coming from Italy, TG,TB &TU isn't bound by these conventions.\nBlondie's the \"good guy\"- but he's also a bounty hunter. He makes a living\nin a highly immoral way, but is obviously the \"good\"- not because we're\ntold, but from small acts- giving the dying soldier a cigar, making sure\nthe\nCaptain knows to hold on till he hears the bridge blow, the genuine regret\nhe feel for having to let Shorty die. And while Angel Eyes may be the Bad,\nwe at least know he has prinicpals- when he's hired for a job, he always\nsees the job through. And Tuco may be more immoral than the other two, but\nhe's so savvy and his role so humorous that one can't bring oneself to\nlook\nupon him disfavorably.\nIn other words, historical inaccuracies aside, TG, TB, & TU maybe one of\nthe\nmost accurate portrayals of the West ever put on film- there are no\nclear-cut lines of conduct, no black and white, or even grey, but just a\nswirled palette of various facets of the human condition.\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060196/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"\n\nOk- first, as mentioned in another review, the geographic/historical\nerrors\nin this film are GLARING.", :clean_text=>"ok first as mentioned in another review the geographic/historical errors in this film are glaring.", :sentiment=>-2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"You've got men carrying revolvers that look like\nold style cap-and-ball pistols, but they're loading them with metallic\ncartridges- historically about five years early.", :clean_text=>"you've got men carrying revolvers that look like old style cap-and-ball pistols but they're loading them with metallic cartridges historically about five years early.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>2, :text=>"Eastwood carries a rifle\nthat hasn't been invented yet, Tuco assembles a \"superpistol\" out of a\nColt,\na Remington, and a Smith and Wesson- impossible.", :clean_text=>"eastwood carries a rifle that hasn't been invented yet tuco assembles a superpistol out of a colt a remington and a smith and wesson impossible.", :sentiment=>-1, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>["Eli Wallach"], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>3, :text=>"And there was nothing of\nmerit taking place between the North and South during the Civil War in the\nSouthwest.", :clean_text=>"and there was nothing of merit taking place between the north and south during the civil war in the southwest.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>4, :text=>"Now, that aside, I must say that this is the Greatest western ever.", :clean_text=>"now that aside i must say that this is the greatest western ever.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>5, :text=>"I\nfirst\nsaw this film when I was about ten.

2006", :content=>"\nOn a partial first viewing, I didn't like \"The Good, the Bad and the\nUgly.\" I thought it was a slow, tedious story about a bunch of\nunpleasant jerk characters involved in a bog-standard conflict over\nmoney. It all seemed very macho and self-consciously cool, and it had\nobviously inspired all the overrated macho directors I don't like in my\nown generation - Tarantino, for example, and Robert Rodriguez. In\nshort, I was unimpressed.Years later, I gave the film a second shot, watching it all the way\nthrough this time. I loved it. What had changed? For one thing, I took more notice of the technical side of the film. I\npaid attention to Leone's famous use of close-ups, his selection of\nmemorable character actors, and his wonderful scene-setting. I admired\nthe detailed sets and the sweeping landscapes, the props and the\ncostumes and all those weird, wonderful faces that Leone clearly loved\nto photograph.I also got hooked by some of the quieter moments that I had skipped\nover in my first viewing. One of the most effective scenes involves Eli\nWallach's character, Tuco, quarreling with his brother when they meet\nafter they've been apart for years. Their argument is great,\nemotionally charged stuff, made all the more effective by the\nsuggestion that they really do love and care about each other. It's the\nkind of sensitive, human scene you never get to see in a Tarantino or\nRodriguez movie.Before I get too fuzzy-wuzzy, I should also like to point out that, on\nmy second viewing, I LOVED all the action, too. Every gunfight is\ngreat, in its own way, and they're all a bit different. The greatest of\nthem all is, of course, the final confrontation between the trio, which\nis accompanied by some of the most rousing music I've ever heard in a\nfilm. And hey, there's even a huge Civil War battle to provide a change\nof pace from all the small-scale action.Ultimately, \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" is probably just a\npotboiler of a film, without too much to say about, for example, the\nhuman condition.

The remarkable thing about Leone's series is the fact that even the best film trilogies (ie The Godfather, the original Star Wars et al) good as they were, never quite captured the magic of the original. Leone's however began brilliantly, and just kept getting better. The trio are introduced in highly effective opening scenes once again, often using only eye contact and body language to convey their personalities; it's actually 10 full minutes into the film before a single syllable is uttered. Leone continues the theme of the old west as an environment of \"every man for himself\" as the characters are constantly backstabbing and lying to each other, even \"the good\" is an immoral con man who betrays his partner as soon as it is convenient (but I guess \"The bad, the bad and the bad\" didn't have the same ring to it!) All of this is set to a backdrop of the American Civil war which is treated in a way that has far more in common with Apocalypse Now than John Ford. The scene in which a drunken Union captain prays for the destruction of a vital bridge to end the carnage is particularly memorable. But it is Eli Wallach's Tuco that virtually steals the film out from under Clint; his immoral and cowardly double crosser brings a lot of humour to the film and was surely a big influence on Johnny Depp whilst creating the character of Captain Jack.

The Ugly is Tuco (Eli Wallach), a degenerate criminal hell bent on getting vengeance on Blondie, but is forced to change his tune when Blondie gains the key information to the hidden gold. The quest for gold begins in front of the back drop of the Civil War as battles impede the movement toward the buried coins and the gritty, bombed out towns serve as a refuge to the treasure hunters.This is the third and final film in the Dollars trilogy and shows how popular and profitable Leone's vision had become. Given a larger budget for TGTBATU, Leone builds a larger world than in any previous dollars film. As in the others the west is a dirty place where there are no cowboys in black and white, just everyone wearing a shade of gray. The Good really isn't very good, he's just a man in his element.  Of course all of the Leone trademarks are present; the close ups and the grand vistas borrowed from John Ford. It's a drastic change from the almost crystal clean westerns of decades before. Is it realistic? Probably not, but life appears a lot closer to real human nature than other westerns. Survival of the fittest is the main theme in these films. When looking at the cast the three leads are perfect. Eastwood's character is obviously a very good rehash from the previous dollars films, but Eli Wallach's Tuco is a sight to be believed. He appears to be bungling, but is actually way ahead when you really delve deeper into his character. \"If you're going to shoot, shoot. Don't talk.\"  The real switch is Lee Van Cleef, who played the fatherly Mortimer in For A Few Dollars More. In TGTBATU he is one of cinemas first natural born killers. A professional at what he does in every sense of the word.The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly has a legacy that has followed it since its release almost two generations ago. The west got harsher. The line between good and bad became blurred, bringing on a decade of the anti-hero. This film still influences directors and writers throughout the world. It is a masterpiece of film making with a story that is epic.

Sergio Leone directs this film with style and every shot is superbly crafted and rich in detail. Leone was a master of his craft, and his talents would ultimately culminate with Once Upon A Time In The West. But The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, remains one of his greatest achievements as a director and was a taste of what was to come. A film that has stood the test of time, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a well crafted film with terrific acting and superb sets.  One of the performances that really stood out for me was Eli Wallach as Tuco. Wallach portrays the character with amusing cruelty. Clint Eastwood gives also a great performance as Blondie.  The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is not a small film by any means. In one long scene, Blondie and Tuco find themselves in a battle with Confederate, and the film almost becomes a totally new story, a film within a film.  The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a masterpiece of cinema and this film is quite possibly the greatest film ever made. Sergio Leone was a masterful storyteller, and with The Good, The Bad and The Ugly he created one of two defining Western films, the other being of course Once Upon A Time In The West. Both films elevated the stature of the Western genre and broke new ground as films in general. Both films went where other Westerns never ventured. Leone  classic film is historically rich and it conveys a sense of accuracy not seen in previous Western films. While Hollywood's Western is clean, good looking with every cliche about the West imaginable. Sergio Leone's West is raw, gritty, ugly and just as nasty as you picture the Wild West to be.  Leone redefined the genre, and used the typical Hollywood cliches of old to his own advantage. Hollywood may have invented the Western genre, but Sergio Leone perfected it. What you have here in The, The Bad and The Ugly is a Western that completely redefined the genre and perfected it.

Not only is it the greatest western ever made and Sergio Leone's masterpiece, but I would say it is absolutely the greatest movie ever made. Most, if not all films have flaws in some way or another, whether it is small or large. In a lot of cases it is either the plot or the execution of the plot. Actors, directors, whatever the case may be. With a lot of Hitchcock's work it is the incredibly fake backdrops and with Lynch it is the bizarre and alienating nature of his films. With The Good, The Bad, &The Ugly there are no flaws or room for disagreement. It is a movie that anyone and everyone can enjoy and appreciate. You don't have to be a fan of westerns or even a big fan of movies for it to be enticing to you.       Very few might argue that the plot isn't all that complicated, but completely disagree. Does a film need to have an obvious baffling plot or series of unanswered questions to be thought provoking? Not at all. In fact, I don't think that should be any film's purpose. Any director should want to give its audience a message and Sergio Leone does that ten fold. He gives us an excellent examination of man and his most obvious flaws. On the surface, yes, it's a movie about treasure and gunslingers. However, with a closer examination there is a lot more going on. You have the end of the civil war going on in the background and a great evaluation of the political state of the west  and it's utter apathy toward the situation. You also see the brutal forms of justice going on at the time and the rise of the capitalism we know today.        Then we have three characters that really set the stage for an amazing ride. Tucco is dirty, despicably and greedy. He never has enough of anything and never learns a thing from his actions. Not even when he is left in the desert for dead does he re-examine his ways. For some reason though, he is an incredibly entertaining character to watch. In many ways I believe it is because we all pity Tucco because he is never going to win no matter how hard he tries. Next, there is Angel Eyes who is incredibly deserving of his title as: The Bad. He is evil in every sense of the word. He kills for money, has no sense of honor and spares no expense to cheat someone. Last, but not least in any way is The Man With No Name a.k.a Blondie. In no way is he the good guy, but he is the character that everyone can identify with, admire and even idolize. He is the gunslinger that you wish you could be and is what most western movies tried to produce, but never quite could. He is the birth of the Anti-Hero.        Now when you look at the acting in this movie, you couldn't ask for a better cast to be on screen. Eli Wallach is perfect for Tucco because he just completely embodies the greedy nature of him. You love to watch him continuously make a fool out of himself and fail time and time again. Now I don't care what anyone says, but Lee Van Cleef is the most under-appreciated actor of the genre. He is the face of the Spaghetti western to me. He has done so many great performances, starting with For A Few Dollars More. He has one of the greatest presences on screen, every time he appears on screen I get the chills. Again, last but not least we have Clint Eastwood. This is his one of his many amazing contributions to film. You can tell from the first moment he appears on screen how completely involved he is with becoming Blondie. To say this is his career best would be wrong because he's done so many other great things with his talent. However, this performance is on par with anything he has done. He also happens to be one of the determining factors in why I love this movie so much. Here is someone who loves film, has a giant respect for his craft and storytelling in general. You can do nothing but stand back and be in awe of his presence.         Sergio Leone is in every respect one of the most important directors in film history. He knows what he's doing and know's what his audience wants. He has one of the greatest respects for Hollywood and entertainment. In saying that, all of his movies are something to treasure. He always put 100% into everything he did. The Good, The Bad, &The Ugly takes some small elements and styles from other films, but it is Leone that makes this a perfect piece of cinema. He manipulates the camera and presents you into to this world that is completely believable and downright fantastical. It's like watching a movie when you're a kid. Everything disappears around you and  you're taken to another person's imagination.", :title=>nil, :location=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"rotten_tomatoes",

From that point on the movie spirals out of control and into the abyss. This is a good thing. The movie holds many meanings andFight Club is multi-faceted movie about a man who is deeply unsatisfied with his life in the modern age, even with all the trappings of success that much of our society is based on, and decides to go off the beaten path to find his own personal satisfaction. From that point on the movie spirals out of control and into the abyss. This is a good thing. The movie holds many meanings and shows the characters in favorable and unfavorable ways. It does not try to cast things in a typical good and evil view point, nor does it say whether the choices the protagonist and the rest of the cast make are sound ones. One of the things it does do is look into the nature of our past, viewing the structure of our society and analyzing why we do what we do to live. It isn't until the narrator (Edward Norton) begins to destroy himself that he finally comes to realize what matters to him. That is when he meets two important characters, Marla Singer and Tyler Durden. It is during this time that the narrator escapes from his normal life by hosting with Tyler an underground fight club that evolved from the two just fighting outside of a local bar. Taking in Tyler's view on life, which is somewhat refreshing and scary at the same time, they form a close bond strongly resembling a married couple. The two do everything together and the narrator begins to emulate Tyler more and more, all the while the fight club grows stronger and stronger until it has become this cult-like phenomenon with Tyler and the narrator as leaders making rules for conducting fight club. Anarchy and non-conformity is their message, which I believe is meant to underscore the irony of fight club and their non-conformist, fight the man attitude. As the group evolves into something more dangerous, this irony becomes more apparent in the way those who once questioned the established authority, now blindly follow their \"non-conformist\" new group. Its been a little over a decade since Fight Club \"enlightened\" me, but it still gives me the same conflicting feelings about its message and the nature of humanity in general. There are those who would take it at its face value and see nothing but frustrated, grown men beating each other senselessly, and that's a shame because there is definitely much more going on then that. David Fincher has crafted an excellent movie: it's disgustingly stylish in its execution...almost too much, if that's possible. The sound track, done by the Dust Brothers burrowed it's way into my brain and never left. The movie would not be the same without it. As far as the actors performances, Ed Norton and Brad Pitt both have a strong rapport and the scenes come off naturally, while Helena Bonham Carter's Marla is hauntingly tragic, and filled with a desperate, but subtle sadness to her. At the time of the original screening this movie polarized people into the two camps of love or hate, due to it's ability to offended or amaze, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Too often are movies eager to please. This one strives to offend and cause questions...and I love it for that.", :useful=>[28.0, 31], :username=>"zombiehampster", :date=>"Oct 28, 2010", :location=>nil, :title=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"metacritic", :url=>"http://www.metacritic.com/movie/fight-club"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"Fight Club is multi-faceted movie about a man who is deeply unsatisfied with his life in the modern age, even with all the trappings of success that much of our society is based on, and decides to go off the beaten path to find his own personal satisfaction.

Lots of movies try to be hyper stylized, interestingly crafted, confusingly brilliant, and narratively abstract. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, actually I love different, but what I'm trying to say is that everyone tries to be \"the first\" and no one does a better job at creating something like that than Fight Club. Fight Club is the definitive perfect movie. Not one movie does what this movie has accomplished and I don't think any other movie will ever do something like this again. It's the exact definition of abstract and I think that is a beautiful thing. There's a lot I have to say about this movie because this one is very near and dear to my heart and I know it is with a lot of other people too, but I also know that a good amount of people also hate this movie, but that's just part of the beauty. It has the unique ability to both be worshiped, and be despised all at the same time. I'm a worshiper. If you haven't seen Fight Club you will probably guess that it's all about two guys who create a club that lets people release their aggression by beating each other to a pulp. Well, that is a part of it, but a surprisingly very small one. That's just the background, not only is Fight Club one of the most narratively abstract movies I have ever seen, it is also the movie with the most underlying themes. Fight Club is about much, much more than just fighting. You may have heard the line, \"this is your life and it’s ending one minute at a time.\" Well, I live by that line, literally. This was also the first lesson that I picked up from this film full of great lessons, you have to live your life to the fullest. You shouldn't care what other people think, do it for yourself and do it quick because the clocks ticking. This brings us to our next lesson. Edward Norton plays the main character known as \"the narrator.\" We meet him as a traveling automobile company employee who has insomnia. This character is a very interesting character because he goes through a very large change throughout the movie. Before he meets Tyler Durden he is known as the \"everyman.\" He is emotionally unstable and he tends to put all of his worries and fears into his possessions and he is one of those people who has to hold onto his structure and have everything straight and tidy and it becomes a problem. That is the next lesson, you have to let go. The average human is stuck in a box going about their average days going through their daily cycles until they go to bed, and they could be doing a lot more. \"You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake.\" So embrace that and use it to your advantage. Embrace the fact that God may not like you, \"we are God's unwanted children, so be it!\" Now let’s talk about Tyler Durden for a second. This guy is indisputably the coolest character in all of movies, ever. You see him and your just like, I want to be him. The best part about him is that he is relatable in the strangest way. I can relate to him although he is completely insane. Even though he is completely insane, he does in a way symbolize all of us, but in our most free state. Tyler Durden is free; he is chaos, which is the exact opposite of Edward Norton. This then ties in with our next theme, freedom. The fight club that is created is in every way illegal, and the whole point of it is to get away from all the rules and your dull and normal life. “At the end of a fight, nothing is resolved yet nothing matters.” That tells you everything you need to know about these people. The first two rules are “you do not talk about Fight Club,” as you probably know. Rules? Yes, there are rules in fight club, but rules are meant to be broken. How can Fight Club spread if no one talks about it? That’s the point; Fight Club thrives on the breaking of its own rules because the whole point of it is to set you free from rules. It’s not even with those first two rules either. In the movie there is a fight between Edward Norton and this other guy and Norton literally beats the living hell out of him breaking the third rule, “when someone says stop, or goes limp the fight is over.” Afterward Norton says that he was feeling destructively beautiful and that’s all that matter in the end. Fight Club is a movie for the generations. It is a cult masterpiece that will never seize to amaze and disturb its viewers. It is a polarizing film and I am proud to say that I am a part of the following. Never believe that it’s all about the fighting, it’s not. It’s about much, much more than that and even with all the blood and violence; this movie shines as a disturbingly beautiful film. David Fincher does an outstanding job with the directing which is masterful to say the least and the two leads kill it. Plus with a surprise twist that you will never see coming, this movie just brings more and more to the table. A brilliant and yes, beautiful film that I wish to show my children one day.", :useful=>[3.0, 3], :username=>"TylerDsCreation", :date=>"May 10, 2013", :location=>nil, :title=>nil,

What do you do if you’re sick of your boring, pathetic life? In the most cathartic, DIY approach possible, Fight Club answers this question: you change it. The absolute prototype of an existential thriller, it wouldn’t be taking too much of a leap to suggest that Fight Club is one of the best films ever made. Jim Uhls’ excellently adapted screenplay of Chuck Palahniuk’s novel (this is the only major work by Uhls that I can find), this thriller has been exciting male audiences the world over since its release in 1999. Even Palahniuk himself said the film was amazing. In fact, he admitted that film was so good, the book in comparison made him feel ashamed. A nameless, pitiful, seemingly friend and family-less Office worker (Edward Norton) suffers from insomnia. True to Palahniuk’s style, the solution to the insomnia comes in a bizarre way. He finds relief by attending support groups for diseases, diseases he doesn’t have; these people really listen to him, and afterwards, he sleeps. At these meetings he meets Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Character), a nemesis and lover, and it is through her that Mr. Office worker discovers his true self, but not until after he’s transformed more than just his own life. Mr. Pitiful Office worker meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Durden helps Mr. Pitiful Office worker admit to his misery once and for all. Channeling their suppressed male aggression in its rawest form, they start fighting each other. Soon Mr. Pitiful Office worker realizes that he and Durden are not alone. Men, downtrodden, tired of their insignificance as worthless individuals all aim to do something greater. They jump at the chance to vent their primal steam, and the solo fights turn into group fights. Durden’s vision eventually transcends aggression in its physical form and becomes something much greater, a community where the individual ceases to exist. As part of this whole, every unnamed member is an equal and significant contributor, and it is through the whole that the individual finds meaning. As part of the whole they are changing the future together. This movie is a directing marvel. With time shifts, psychological manipulations, and very meticulous scene planning, we are kept on the edge of our seats for the entire film. Accompanied by the pounding soundtrack composed by the Dust Brothers, Fincher achieves the rarity of making a movie better than a book. Fincher turns the concrete basement of Lou’s Tavern into perhaps the most famous arena in all of modern film. The house on Paper Street, a lone abandoned mansion, becomes a factory of redefinition, of reinvention. In the final scene an amazing mesh between the visuals and the music, The Pixies’ “Where is my Mind,” Fincher creates one of the most stunning combinations of sight and sound in all of film. And it's a pretty damn good ending to the plot too. The most memorable scene is when Durden is behind the wheel of a car full of passengers. He buckles up, pins the gas, and lets go of the wheel. The car veers off the road and crashes, flipping multiple times. We are force fed the hard truth here. The Fight Club mantra: to change to our lives we need to rid ourselves of our past failures, forget the job, the kids, the car, the living room, the flat screen HDTV, and just let go.

He, in turn, forms a 'fight club' with Tyler Durden (Pitt) a soap maker to escape from this sedative lifestyle. Now right off the bat, if this movie were shown to the original pioneers of film (i.e. Porter, Chaplin, Capra) I can safely say that upon completion of the film they would promptly scream, yell, cry, and then explode. . . .maybe. They would definitely be appalled by what they would see. However, this does not make \"Fight Club\" a bad film. For, film, like literature, can take on many forms and eventually evolve over time. Though the themes displayed throughout the film are definitely strange and at times shocking, they are also peculiarly thought-provoking and at times pragmatic. The movie's messages on defiance and nihilism are deeply rooted within it's very intelligently written script. The dialogue is hilarious and at times disturbingly provocative. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are two intensely talented actors, and seeing them work together on screen is really entertaining. Though anyone who watches this movie will walk out of the film talking about Brad Pitt's unforgettable portrayal of Tyler Durden. Pitt's obvious dedication to the role, paired with the near-perfectly written script he was given, makes for a character that I will quote many a time to come. Another aspect that I found particularly unique was the cinematography. I found that Photographic Director Jeff Cronenweth did a noteworthy job with the visuals of this movie. He really succeeded in using lighting to accentuate just how dismally somnolent the narrator's life is. I also felt that the use of lighting towards the end of the film was also very aesthetic.

The twist got me, but that didn't resolve any of my questions. This movie is incredibly disjointed. The main character has no logical reason to be doing the things he does in the film, and the motive is so pretentious and stupid that re-wording it outside the film is impossible. Aside from the sloppy and disjointed plot, the acting was very strong and it had good cinematography. Soundtrack wise, this movie doesn't have any standout tracks, which is a bit disappointing. The movie runs for a little over two hours, which is ridiculously long. Not only that, but it's paced very poorly in my opinion. Nothing really happens until the twist, and even then you're too confused to even care what happens. Overall, Fight Club was a disappointment.

At first glance, this may seem like a simple testostorone based film that takes place within an actual fight club. Look further, for this is so much more. It is a satire on modern life, using things like schizophrenia & terrorism to illustrate this. Edward Nortons nameless narrator character meets two people who change his life: Tyler Durden (played by Brad Pitt) and Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) With Tyler, the narrator creates a fight club, in which people who are stressed out and pissed off come to unload steam by beating the crap out of each other. It does make sense, by unloading your stress onto another person, concentrating it into every blow, you feel better about your day. The fight club then turns into something else entirely, an anarchic group whom commit acts of vandalism with cheer and smiles on their faces. Tylers actions may be anarchic, but they make sense. He believes everything has become so complicated with us wanting things we do not need, so sets out to destroy these things, like Starbucks. Each of the actors play their role convincingly. Edward Nortons insomniac narrator is a brilliant creation, along with the bat **** insane Tyler Durden. I gotta talk about the twist, that Tyler is actually another personality of the narrator. Once you know about this twist, watch the film a second time. You will see it make sense, and see the twist being sown earlier on into the story little by little. It is gritty also. For an example, see Edward Norton beating into Jared Letos face. Its so bloody. And when you see Tyler throwing Edward down the stairs, you know its actually Edward Norton throwing himself down the stairs, and thats a little creepy. The humour as well, Tylers earlier jobs, cutting porn into kids films and pissing in soup, is hilarious. Also, fight club members trying to start fights. They even cut a porn shot into the end of the film How can you not love this film? The acting, the writing, the direction, the twist, the storyline, its all brilliant.

Well, that's an option --  but watch closely in the movie's second half and see how subtly and  hilariously Fincher undermines this: the anarchists begin to chant  management-speak, to dissolve into a collective identity, and to form  franchises as if they were selling frappucino rather than revolution.  Norton is especially horrified at all this, and his wonderful reactions to  the disintegration of 'Project Mayhem' are the calm (and moral) centre of  the film.

Good-looking, brash, arrogant, fights like a tank, takes a beating like a tank, ****s like a machine and doesn't do any REAL work.The Narrator [Ed Norton] is the manifestation of most modern men's reality. Plain-looking, dead-end job, no stable relationship, a decent collection of lifestyle accessories and sheer boredom.When the two meet, you might expect the movie takes the usual route where the two men get to learn from each other, and find that each person's life has as many highs as pitfalls, and that your life is what you make of it. Err...no. Tyler is an enigma. A revolutionary of sorts. Hell, he isn't here to \"learn\" about the Narrator. He's here to \"Jack\" his life!!!

He could easily program the Terminator to believe its existence was useless and that it should self-terminate. He might even make Neo give-up and dump the whole \"Because I choose to..\" talk.This movie may not \"change\" your life, but it will affect it. You will develop a liking for red leather. You will start working on a new walk. You will start sizing people up everywhere you go. You will stop caring about the fact that you're a 6-foot 120-lbs weakling with 13\" biceps. You will start to think, \"I'm sure I could throw ONE good dislocating punch at a 220lbs biker even after I take 4 punches to my face\". You will want to be in better shape. You will cringe at the idea of a woman having any kind of control over your life. You will want to learn the art of dead-pan sarcasm that scares your boss out of his/her wits. Watch this movie, and you will wish that someday, people will ask, \"Say, Who is (insert your name)?\"One of the better \"mainstream\" movies to have come out of Hollywood in recent years.

How is it that the general America public completely missed the boat on a movie that struck dead center as a  perfect parody of our society?  I have to draw the conclusion that Fight  Club was received relatively poorly at the box office because most people  could not understand its primary themes and messages.I'm a 30-something  male living in 'middle' America and from what I see; our society is  tittering on the edge of self destruction.  Children are rampaging through  schools with shotguns reenacting scenes from Quake and the consensus  solution is - take away guns?  The polar caps are melting and the news  reports that scientists still have no proof of global warming?  The  population is growing at an exponential rate as our health care system  approaches financial melt down attempting to sustain every human  life.What does this have to do with Fight Club?  Obesity is at an all  time high in this country, and it serves as a flawless metaphor of America  - Fat & Happy.  Fight Club puts America (in all of its ugly glory)  right in your face, and it appears that the majority of the public is too  close to the forest to see the trees.  Fight Club says \"We'll take  their liposuction fat, repackage it in a nice wrapper and sell it back to  them as soap\".  That's an ugly concept that most people don't want to  even think about.I have asked a number of people what they though this  movie was about, and they essentially respond - guys with mental problems  who start a club to act as a venue for macho brawls.  Were my peers  sleeping during their viewings?It was reported that when this movie was  first screened at the movie studio, the executives involved were concerned  about being investigated for promoting fascism.  This movie takes aim at  \"the system\", \"the man\", \"the establishment\"  and strikes dead on.  On the DVD, there are supplementary commentaries from  all the major players involved with Fight Club.  At one point during the  dialog, Ed Norton says that when he read the script; he was amazed by the  depth, complexity and originality of this movie.  After the movie was  released, he was criticized along with Pitt for pandering to Hollywood's  violent tendencies.It may be true that the only reason Hollywood  green-lighted this picture was because of the violence, but I don't think  they truly understood what they had authorized.  If you choose to watch  this movie for the first time (or repeatedly which I highly recommend)  focus on getting past the violence.  The fighting is used as a concept  vehicle - we all live in a stress-induced coma that is perpetuated through  the daily trials and tribulations of life.  The way that the characters  wake up from their coma is by experiencing primordial pain - fighting.  Once they are awake, they recognize that they have been asleep all of their  lives.  Oddly similar to The Matrix, but the similarities end there.By  endorsing this movie, I'm not purporting that we are all silently asleep at  the wheel.  Neither movies nor their reviews can completely cover complex  concepts in a nice simple package.  As Norton touched on in the commentary,  this movie has more thought provoking ideas than almost any other I can  think of.  The sad part about Fight Club is the fact that it has become a  self-fulfilled prophecy.  Its mediocre showing at the box office reinforces  Hollywood's perception that the general public is becoming increasingly  comatose - we want intellectual Big Mac EXTRA value meals as opposed to  Steak au Poivre.Could you make sure to put heavy violence and low  thought on that Big Mac?  Fincher, Norton and Pitt all proved that they had  big coconuts to make this movie, and I don't think anyone even noticed  their contribution.

In a shaky pullback we emerge from Jack's mouth that has the barrel  of a gun jammed inside it.Jack is a loner, a man going nowhere fast, an  angst-ridden emasculated wage-slave with terrible insomnia. He seeks  solace, rather bizarrely, in victim support groups, feeding off the misery  of others Sleep comes to him at last and he becomes addicted to the  self-help ethos. That is, until he is exposed by another fake attendee,  Marla. Without the group empathy and misery-fix to soothe his troubles,  Jack hurtles deeper into depression, culminating in his apartment  exploding. In his deep dark night of the soul he turns to Tyler  Durden.Tyler Durden is the embodiment of pure id: an existential  nihilist, a sociopath with terrorist inclinations, inhabiting a dilapidated  decaying brownstone on the edge of existence. He scavenges human fat from  liposuction clinics to make into soap to sell back to the rich ladies it  came from; urinates in the soup of the restaurant in which he works; and,  moonlighting as a projectionist, he splices single frames of pornography  into family movies.

But, quite simply, Fight Club is, without  doubt, one of the most subversive pieces of cinema, ever. And. With a  denouement twist that is, unlike The Sixth Sense, impossible to  guess.Based on a controversial novel by Chuck Palanhiuk, Fight Club is a  relentlessly dark, tortuous journey of one man's self-discovery. Hoisted up  to greatness by Fincher's incredible vision and by career best performances  from both Norton and Pitt, it is one of those rare films that is quite  unlike anything that has preceded it. It is intelligent, funny,  ultra-violent, touching, repulsive, in equal measures: and, an  excruciatingly accurate study of maleness and virility to boot (which,  critics take heed, doesn't

When the movie was first promoted for its debut in theatres, the advertisements, I believe, gave a misrepresentative impression of the film's actual content.  I thought, like many others, that Fight Club was going to be another lackluster production filled with all the clichés you would expect to see in a Van Damme-esque action misadventure.  It took some goading but I finally decided to give this movie a chance, and I would highly suggest that anyone who has not should do the same.For anyone who is tired of the prefabricated plot lines that dominate today's movie industry, you know the ones for teeny-boppers and the sequels to movies unfit for original production, Fight Club is a refreshing alternative.  The star-studded cast, Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter, provide the perfect chemistry for this deceptively brilliant critique of the modern man.  David Fincher, who also collaborated with Pitt in the movie Seven, captures the essence Chuck Palahniuk's novel with beautiful cinematography.The junior executive, played by Norton, is struggling to swallow his mundane existence.  He suffers from a variety of ailments, from depression to insomnia.  Norton's character, the narrator, whose name is never revealed during the film, an example of the subtle nuances that make this production so appealing, lacks a sense of identity, as is expressed in the following quote: \"I'd look through the catalog and think, what kind of furniture defines me as a man?\"  Palahniuk, very cleverly, illustrates how disillusioned and materialistic society has become.  Tyler's occupation of a soap salesman is yet another example.  He sells his luxurious soap, made from lye and the pilfered fat from liposuction clinics, back to the very clients who supplied the materials.Underneath the comedy, the drama, and, at times, the brutal violence, lays an exceptional social satire.  Norton's character and his partner in crime Tyler Durden, played by Pitt, revolt against the twenty-first century image of man.  A prime example of Palanhiuk's contempt for the feminization of man occurs when the two board a bus.  They see a Calvin Klein advertisement of a perfectly groomed young adult male devoid of imperfections and body hair.  Tyler asks, \"Is that what a man looks like?\"  They both laugh and express their sympathy for people following the path of superficial self-improvement.The film broaches some rather controversial social issues, which separate it from most conservative contemporary pieces.  Many women, mothers especially, were offended by the line, \"We're a generation of men raised by women; I'm wondering if another woman in my life is really what I need?\"  I thought that was a goal films; they are supposed to be about eliciting emotion.This film's cast and director combined to produce a film that will not be soon forgotten.  From the horror of the Norton and Leto fight scene to the compassion and sorrow of support group scenes, Fight Club takes you on an eye-opening voyage through the mind of a man gone mad from banality.

I popped\nit in, sat in amazement until the last credit rolled, and then watched it\nagain.  And again.  And again.This movie is dark and disturbing, however, it is equally smart and\nstylistic.  I found it hard to watch at points, but I couldn't turn my eyes\naway.  Fight Club makes many bold statements against the modern\nconsumer-driven society, and produces Norton's best performance and Pitt's\nsecond best (12 Monkeys).Norton plays an average-Joe who is living a dead-end life.

These two\nmovies share quite a bit in common - both were based on great books.  If you\nhaven't read either, get to it.

I, however, couldn't wait to read\nthe book after seeing this film. I've read the book 5 times since and seen\nthe movie more times than I can remember. Simply put, this movie changed my life. Not just on a personal level (on\nwhich I will not comment here except to say I'm now a major Palahniuk fan)\nbut also as a movie-watcher. I view movies differently after seeing this\nmovie, because it broke down doors. This movie is literally the first time I ever came upon something that, at\nfirst sight seemed incredibly stylish, sophisticated and entertaining. The\nplot lured you in before turning you upside down, the acting was nothing\nshort of perfect (has there ever been a more memorable character than Brad\nPitt as Tyler Durden?), the music, the screenplay (based on what is now my\nall-time favorite book), the lighting, the pacing, the everything! Virtually\neverything about this movie took my by surprise, save for one man. David Fincher, director, was probably the only reason I went to see this\nmovie in the first place. His work on 'Seven' and 'The Game' had me excited\nto see what he would do next, but I came to this movie expecting a stylish\nflick that offered a good plot and hopefully some good acting but what I got\nwas so much, much more. Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that, with every viewing,\ngets even more complicated yet so simple that you can't help but laugh.\nEvery time I watch this movie I notice something new about it, such is the\ndepth of what is on the screen. Then there's the tiny issue of the story of\nFight Club, penned by Chuck Palahniuk (who has one of the most fertile\nimaginations around. Don't believe me? Read 'Survivor' and weep!) the story\nis nothing short of incredible, a pure shock-value social commentary on the\nstate of the world at the end of the century. You'll cry, you'll laugh,\nyou'll do all the clichés but most importantly you'll identify with every\nsingle thing on the screen. This movie rates as one of my all-time favorite movies and, simply put, if\nyou haven't seen it yet then quit wasting your time OnLine and get to the\nnearest videostore! 5/5\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"\n\nI am, unfortunately, not one of the faithful Chuck Palahniuk readers who had\nread the book BEFORE they saw the movie.", :clean_text=>"i am unfortunately not one of the faithful chuck palahniuk readers who had read the book before they saw the movie.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"I, however, couldn't wait to read\nthe book after seeing this film.", :clean_text=>"i however couldn't wait to read the book after seeing this film.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>2, :text=>"I've read the book 5 times since and seen\nthe movie more times than I can remember.", :clean_text=>"i've read the book 5 times since and seen the movie more times than i can remember.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>3, :text=>"Simply put, this movie changed my life.", :clean_text=>"simply put this movie changed my life.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>4, :text=>"Not just on a personal level (on\nwhich I will not comment here except to say I'm now a major Palahniuk fan)\nbut also as a movie-watcher.", :clean_text=>"not just on a personal level on which i will not comment here except to say i'm now a major palahniuk fan but also as a movie-watcher.", :sentiment=>1, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>5, :text=>"I view movies differently after seeing this\nmovie, because it broke down doors.", :clean_text=>"i view movies differently after seeing this movie because it broke down doors.", :sentiment=>-2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>6, :text=>"This movie is literally the first time I ever came upon something that, at\nfirst sight seemed incredibly stylish, sophisticated and entertaining.", :clean_text=>"this movie is literally the first time i ever came upon something that at first sight seemed incredibly stylish sophisticated and entertaining.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>7, :text=>"The\nplot lured you in before turning you upside down, the acting was nothing\nshort of perfect (has there ever been a more memorable character than Brad\nPitt as Tyler Durden?", :clean_text=>"the plot lured you in before turning you upside down the acting was nothing short of perfect has there ever been a more memorable character than brad pitt as tyler durden?", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{:plot=>75, :cast=>50}, :emphasis=>2.0, :people_tags=>["Brad Pitt"], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>8, :text=>"), the music, the screenplay (based on what is now my\nall-time favorite book), the lighting, the pacing, the everything!", :clean_text=>"the music the screenplay based on what is now my all-time favorite book the lighting the pacing the everything!", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{:sound=>100}, :emphasis=>2.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>9, :text=>"Virtually\neverything about this movie took my by surprise, save for one man.

Taking\nthe \"Choose life,\" anti-consumerism rant at the beginning\nof \"Trainspotting,\" and carrying it to its logical -- albeit\nextreme -- conclusion this is a big budget, mainstream film\nthat takes a lot of risks by biting the hand that feeds\nit.\nThe film's narrator (Edward Norton) is an insignificant cog\nin the drab, corporate machine, dutifully doing his job and\nwhat he's told without question. He's an insomniac slave to\nhis IKEA possessions and only finds joy in going to as\nmany self-help/dealing with terminal diseases sessions\nas he can. It provides him with an escape from his\nsleepless nights. That is, until Marla Singer (Helena\nBonham Carter), a trashy chain-smoking poser, enters his\nlife and upsets his routine. The narrator also meets Tyler\nDurden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic soap salesman whose\nstraightforward honesty, candor and sleazy lounge-lizard\noutfits are a breath of fresh air.\nOne night, after the two men have bonded over beers, Tyler\nasks the narrator to hit him. At first, it seems like an absurd\nrequest but after they pound on each other for a bit, a\nstrange feeling overcomes them. They feel a kind of\nrelease and satisfaction at inflicting pain on one another. In\na world where people are desensitized to everything\naround them, the physical contact of fighting wakes them\nup and makes them feel truly alive. Others soon join in and\npretty soon Fight Club becomes an underground\nsensation. However, it becomes readily apparent that Tyler\nhas more elaborate plans than just organizing brawls at\nthe local bar.\nDavid Fincher has taken the dark, pessimistic worldview of\n\"Seven\" and married it with the clever plot twists and turns\nof \"The Game\" and assembled his strongest effort to date.\n\"Fight Club\" is a $50+ million studio film that remains true\nto its anti-consumer, anti-society, anti-everything message\n-- right up to the last, sneaky subliminal frame.\nWhat makes \"Fight Club\" a subversive delight is not only its\nrefreshing anti-corporate message but how it delivers said\nmessage. As Fincher has explained in interviews, you don't\nreally watch the film but rather download it. Its structure is\nextremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an\nincredible degree. The narrative bounces back and forth all\nover the place like a novel, or surfing on the Internet -- even\nmaking a hilarious dead stop to draw attention to itself in a\nfunny, interesting way that completely works. Yet Norton's\ndeadpanned narration holds everything together and\nallows the viewer to get a handle on what's happening.\nThis is the way films should be made. Why must we\nalways have to go through the A+B+C formula? \"Fight Club\"\nopenly rejects this tired, clearly outdated structure in favour\nof a stylized frenzy of jump cuts, freeze frames, slow motion\nand every other film technique in the book that only\nreinforces its anarchistic message.\nA film like this would have never been greenlighted by a\nmajor studio if Brad Pitt had not been attached to the\nproject. Once you see the film, it becomes obvious that he\nwas the only choice for Tyler Durden. Like he did with\n\"Kalifornia\" and \"Twelve Monkeys\", Pitt grunges himself\ndown and disappears completely into his role to a\nfrighteningly convincing degree. During many of the brutal\nfight scenes, he is transformed into a bloody, pulpy mess\nthat'll surely have the \"Legends of the Fall\" fans running for\nthe exits. It is an incredible performance -- probably his\nbest -- for the simple fact that he becomes the character so\ncompletely.\nIf Pitt has the flashy, gonzo role, Edward Norton is his\nperfect foil as the seemingly meek yet sardonic narrator. It's\na deceptively understated performance as the last third of\nthe film reveals but Norton nails it perfectly. He is clearly\nour surrogate, our introduction into this strange world and\nhis wry observations on our consumer-obsessed culture\nare right on the money. They are the perfect setup for\nTyler's introduction and his view on the world which is\nclearly a call to arms of sorts, a manifesto that rejects the\nnotion that we are what we own.\nAnd ultimately, that is what \"Fight Club\" tries to do. The film\nis a cinematic punch to the head as it challenges the\nstatus quo and offers a wakeup call to people immersed in\na materialistic world where those who have the most stuff,\n\"win.\" I think that Fincher's film wants us to tear all that\ndown, reject corporate monsters like Starbucks and\nBlockbuster, and try to figure out what we really want out of\nlife. It's almost as if the film is suggesting salvation through\nself-destruction. And it is these thought-provoking ideas\nthat makes \"Fight Club\" a dangerously brilliant film that\nentertains as well as enlightens.\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb",

This film is not only one of cinema's greatest treasures, it is also my favorite film ever made. This work of art takes us into Steven Spielberg's vision of the Holocaust, and serves us a deep and thrilling story about a hero who saved hundreds of people due to his bravery and courageousness. Steven Spielberg is a true genius; in his career he has created classics such as Raiders of the Lost Ark or E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, but no film he has ever crafted will ever live up to this one epic masterpiece of a film that changed the world of cinema forever as we know it. When this film released in 1993, Steven Spielberg proved that he was not just a great filmmaker, he was an artist. He gives the film so much power and depth to the characters and story, and no drama film will ever be able to touch the soul as this film did for me. A masterpiece like this is hardly ever released, and it's not only about the Holocaust itself, it's also about a hero and how he stood up to the walls that surrounded him. Oskar Schindler is one of the greatest heroes the world has ever known in my opinion, a member of the Nazi party who saw the corruption of what was going in this terrible time and did all that he could to save as many Jews as possible. In the film he witnesses a girl in a red dress walking through the streets of Poland as Nazi's are grabbing Jews, and later he sees the girl in that same dress dead along with the other Jews about to be burned. This revelation changes Schindler from a businessman into a man who sees the true evil of The Holocaust. Oskar really is a flawed man as well, he has his problems like any normal human but his intentions still make me see him as a great man. Liam Neeson's performance in this film is almost too good to be true, and he deserved an Academy Award. This is acting at its absolute best and his final scene where he cries over the fact that he could've saved more people always brings me to tears. Ralph Fiennes plays a truly sinister man as Amon Goeth, one of the worst men I have ever witnessed in a film. He is ruthless and insane, but we see in some scenes that he is in love with a Jewish woman named Helen. This is a very important part of his character, as it shows he has humanity inside him and that proves that he truly is a horrible man if he can feel love and compassion and still be that ruthless. Fiennes plays this role brilliantly, and his darkness and depth he gives the character amazes me to this day. Ben Kingsley plays Itzhak Stern who is Schindler's accountant and business partner during the events of the film, and he really is a symbol of Schindler's bravery. He has a Jewish man working for him and they soon become very close, and that proves that Schindler truly grows a love for the Jewish people that begin working for him. Ben Kinglsey is flawless as always and was truly the only man who could've pulled off the character with such passion and sympathy. Steven Spielberg has always taken us into films where we wish we could've joined the adventure, but this was his first movie where I wanted nothing to do where he had taken us. While other Holocaust masterpieces like The Pianist or Life is Beautiful are incredible for showing the survival of the Hlocaust, this one is a masterpiece for showing the brutality of it. This was like nothing he had done before, and I am overwhelmed with happiness that other people love this film as much as I do. This flawless masterpiece has been criticized by many ignorant people that have different issues with the film, and I think that' they have issues with the fact they couldn't think of a better film themselves. Spielberg is truly, in my opinion, the greatest director of all time, mainly because he has been able to bring us both dramatic masterpieces like this and entertaining masterpieces like Indiana Jones or Jaws. Schindler's List is my all-time favorite film, and for me, no other drama will ever be able to live up to the visionary genius that Spielberg has given us, and no other film will ever effect me like this movie has done.", :useful=>[1.0, 1], :username=>"BreakingBrad", :date=>"Jan 24, 2013", :location=>nil, :title=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"metacritic", :url=>"http://www.metacritic.com/movie/schindlers-list"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"Schindler's List is an epic masterpiece that reaches down into the soul of human nature and plays with the strings of our hearts and minds by sending us to one of the worst places imaginable.", :clean_text=>"schindler's list is an epic masterpiece that reaches down into the soul of human nature and plays with the strings of our hearts and minds by sending us to one of the worst places imaginable.", :sentiment=>1, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"This film is not only one of cinema's greatest treasures, it is also my favorite film ever made.", :clean_text=>"this film is not only one of cinema's greatest treasures it is also my favorite film ever made.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>2, :text=>"This work of art takes us into Steven Spielberg's vision of the Holocaust, and serves us a deep andSchindler's List is an epic masterpiece that reaches down into the soul of human nature and plays with the strings of our hearts and minds by sending us to one of the worst places imaginable.", :clean_text=>"this work of art takes us into steven spielberg's vision of the holocaust and serves us a deep andschindler's list is an epic masterpiece that reaches down into the soul of human nature and plays with the strings of our hearts and minds by sending us to one of the worst places imaginable.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>["Steven Spielberg"], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>3, :text=>"This film is not only one of cinema's greatest treasures, it is also my favorite film ever made.", :clean_text=>"this film is not only one of cinema's greatest treasures it is also my favorite film ever made.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>4, :text=>"This work of art takes us into Steven Spielberg's vision of the Holocaust, and serves us a deep and thrilling story about a hero who saved hundreds of people due to his bravery and courageousness.", :clean_text=>"this work of art takes us into steven spielberg's vision of the holocaust and serves us a deep and thrilling story about a hero who saved hundreds of people due to his bravery and courageousness.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{:plot=>100}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>["Steven Spielberg"], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>5, :text=>"Steven Spielberg is a true genius; in his career he has created classics such as Raiders of the Lost Ark or E.T.

Spielberg has made a name for himself in the film industry by reducing serious subjects to the lowest denominator until it's no more than any mawkish family melodrama. Why should a movie about the Holocaust be any different? Schindler's List is an aesthetic mess and exemplifies everything that's wrong about Hollywood. First off, the movie's primary focus is to show us how Oscar Schindler, a slave owner aiming to run his factories through jew labour for monetary profit, turns into a defender of jews' rights and the protector of their lives. But the problem is Schindler's transformation is portrayed in an extremely poor way. In fact, there is no transformation. Midpoint in the film, the Schindler persona has disappeared, and we have a new character clothed in the same flesh -- a self-sacrificing philanthropist who spends his entire amassed fortune to save the Jew workers. How did we get from one to the other? And then we have Amon Goeth. He's an evil, sadistic, Jew-hating Nazi - but do we get to know why he wakes up every morning, takes a swig of booze and snipes Jew prisoners for fun? No. Spielberg thinks the answer is obvious -- he's a Nazi, and Nazis don't have reasons for the things they do. The attempt to add depth to Göeth's character by dwelling on his twisted love affair with a Jewish girl is easily seen for what it is -- a cheap exposure of Nazi hypocrisy. The true intrigue, the true horror of the Holocaust does not lie in brutality alone, but rather in Hannah Arendt's \"banality of evil\". How can a man (or millions of men) arbitrarily narrow the moral sphere to exclude people seemingly no different from neighbours, friends and family? Another problem is the accent. There are English-speaking films and then there are German-speaking films. Schindler's List, on the other hand, does not belong to either of these categories. One of the truly unforgivable aspects of the film is the ending. When Schindler took off his gold ring and blubbered \"I could have saved one more\", I experienced a feeling of mild revulsion. Spielberg's invariable resort to sentimentality is quintessentially Hollywood, quintessentially cheesy and quintessentially inappropriate for the subject matter of the film. Schindler's List is technically brilliant but Spielberg is a director of extremely limited vision. His moral and intellectual depth is that of a child (and the funny part is Schindler's List may be the most mature movie Spielberg has made till now).", :useful=>[0.0, 1], :username=>"AkashVijay", :date=>"Jan 19, 2015", :location=>nil, :title=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"metacritic", :url=>"http://www.metacritic.com/movie/schindlers-list"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"Sappy, manipulative and a ridiculously oversimplified version of the Holocaust.

Not only is it a masterpiece from a cinematic point of view, but it is priceless for the story it tells to the world.First of all,  the acting is superb. Liam Neeson does well as Oskar Schindler, but in  particular I liked Ben Kingsley (as Istak Stern, Schindler's accountant)  and Ralph Fiennes (as Amon Goeth, the camp commandant). All of the  performances were very convincing and reflect the good  casting.Another great feature of this film is the soundtrack. Slow,  soaring music tells of the painful circumstances of the Jews and of their  conflict with the Nazi regime. Mixed in with the instrumental pieces are  Jewish melodies which also gave me a sense of the cultural traditions of  the Jewish people.From a technical point of view, the decision by  director Spielberg to shoot the movie is black-and-white was a good one. In  fact, I think it makes the movie better than it would have been in color.  The few color segments throughout the movie are aptly placed and help to  focus the viewer's attention on particular details through the eyes of  Schindler. The scenery and photography were excellent compared to other  movies I have seen and contribute to the whole atmosphere of the 1940s.  Some people may be put off a bit by the length (over 3 hours) but believe  me, every minute is worthwhile. Unlike other long movies, there are no  lulls or useless scenes -- everything counts.The best part of the movie  without any doubt is the story itself, the tale of Oskar Schindler and how  he was able to save 1100 Jews from the Auschwitz gas chambers by employing  them in his enamelware factory and eventually his shelling factory.  Schindler's ambition and personal success shines through amidst the Jewish  tragedy and shows how one man, if he has the willpower, can accomplish what  appears to be impossible. Based on the novel by Thomas Keneally (which I  have not yet had the opportunity to read), this movie digs deep into the  human soul and shows how different people are able to survive.There are  many touching moments in this film; in particular, near the end when the  war has been declared over and the Nazis must flee from the Soviet army.  This part and the modern-day segment that follows are both truly  heart-warming tributes. I finished watching this movie for about the fourth  time yesterday, and even though I didn't cry, tears welled up in my eyes  (and this rarely happens when I watch movies).This movie is a must-see  not only for its excellence in the film genre but for the story it presents  to the viewer. Although it is not suitable for young children (due to its  violence and mature content), any mature individual should see it so they  can understand that a spark of good can still exist in a fire of evil. This  movie deserved all of the Academy Awards that it received and will likely  remain in top ten lists for at least the next fifty years.

Spielberg's 1993 masterpiece SCHINDLER'S LIST is one of the most important and enlightening films ever made. It is a heartfelt, deeply personal film about one of the ghastliest events in human history--the Holocaust--and how one man, a Nazi profiteer by the name of Oskar Schindler, while motivated by money, managed to save some 1200 Jews from the gas chambers of Auschwitz during World War II.Spielberg wisely does not gloss over the fact that Schindler was every bit the womanizer as he was an astute, cagey businessman who made deals with the Nazis to set up an enamelware factory in the Cracow ghetto and employ the Jewish populace there. But his very trusted secretary Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) manages to awaken a latent spark of humanity in the once cold-blooded Schindler. By the time the war is over and the facts are known about the Nazi atrocities, Schindler is financially broke but spiritually enriched. \"He who saves one life saves the world entire.\"Filmed in somber, documentary-like black-and-white by Janusz Kaminski, SCHINDLER'S LIST features superb performances by Neeson and Kingsley, as well as British actor Ralph Fiennes as the extraordinarily chilling Nazi commandant Amon Goeth, whose basic senses of Nazi business Schindler must appeal to while keeping the fact that he is sheltering the Jews a secret.

It's a history lesson, an intense drama, and a gripping character study all at once. For me, however, the film really hits home with the realization of the difference that one person can make in the grand scheme of things.For a basic plot summary, \"Schindler's List\" focuses on Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a high-ranking member of the Nazi party during World War II. When the German Nazis invade Poland and begin rounding up Jews into ghettos, Schindler sees it as strictly a business operation, opening up his own pots-and-pans factory using Jewish labor. While raking in the dough on the backs of the Jews, however, Schindler begins to see the escalating brutality of the Nazis and is eventually appalled by their treatment at the concentration camps. Thus, he creates a list of workers that he ultimately hopes to protect from the brutality.As a history-based epic, \"Schindler's List\" manages to capture the essence of the moment AND yet still be subtle about it at the same time. Director Steven Spielberg strikes the perfect balance between drama and realism. The acting performance from Ralph Fiennes as the Nazi Commandant is especially shocking for its ability to depict the brutality of those camps. Essentially, this is a movie that should be shown to American high school students at least once during their education for its ability to show the true horrors of the holocaust.Perhaps the true hallmark of the movie, though, is the character evolution of Mr. Schindler. He starts off as nothing more than a ruthless businessman, but over time (and it quite literally takes almost every minute of the film's 3+ hour runtime to come to fruition) he begins to realize not only the horrors transpiring around him, but also that he has the power (and thus the responsibility) to do something about it. To me, that was the most endearing message that I took from the overall experience.Thus, I consider \"Schindler's List\" to be a masterpiece of American cinema (although, what should I have expected from Mr. Spielberg?!).

a group of seven other people, in a completely full theater.  When the curtain went down and the lights came on, everyone got up and moved to the door, but no one said a word.  Not one.  It was dead quiet all the way out to the street.  I've never experienced anything like that.I was raised knowing all about the six million we lost in the Holocaust, not to mention the five or six million others who died in the camps, but I didn't really get it until Spielberg silenced me and everyone else in the room.  How did he do it?First of all, he chose the right protagonist.  Oskar Schindler, the savior of a thousand Jews, was anything but an angel - he toadied up to those in power unashamedly, paid bribes with money he didn't have, took advantage of the unfortunate for his own ends, cheated endlessly on his wife, and kept his eye on his bottom line to the exclusion of everything else.  He was flawed, vulnerable and human, like you and me, and through his reaction to what he sees we can feel the indescribable horror as we could not through the reactions of a saint.  There's a scene in this movie where Schindler, out for a horseback ride with one of his girlfriends, happens upon a mountain of corpses being burned.  A saint might look sad or angry at such a scene - Liam Neeson's expression is that of a man falling off a cliff he didn't know was there.  Faced with such carnage, that's probably how I'd look, too.Spielberg's other smart move was filming \"Schindler's List\" in black and white.  Siskel and Ebert have pointed out, rightly, that black and white makes images appear somehow eternal, like historical documents rather than mere pictures.  That's certainly true here, but it works on many levels.  Sometimes the black and white photography has a matte finish and takes on the character of news photography, showing how banal (and therefore how terrifying) an image is, such as those times when Ralph Fiennes Commandant Goeth shoots a few passing prisoners for breakfast.  On the other hand, \"Schindler's List\" contains a great many images that look like they were etched on mirrors, such as the famous shot of a little boy hiding from the Nazis at the bottom of a latrine.  At those moments, even when (as one character says) \"all around lies the gulf,\" the pictures soak up a truly heavenly light, as though Someone were watching.The performers involved certainly behave as though Someone were watching, and they turn in the work of their lives, from the stars to the bit players.  Neeson has just the right sort of big, craggy face that can show decadence one minute and agony the next, and he's got the talent to run the whole gamut in all the right places.  Fiennes, in his first major role, resembles nothing so much as a sort of human hog, but a cunning and crazed one - he seems able to sweat on cue.  Ben Kingsley as Schindler's factory manager, with almost no change in his facial expression, makes us see how he moves from suspicion to hope to love for this strange animal, his boss.  And besides these monumental performances, there's the black marketeer who finagles his customers with one breath and loves his wife with the next; the engineer who sacrifices her life to the fact that concrete needs to be poured with care; the old hinge-maker who waits on his knees for a miracle involving a jammed gun; the pretty young woman who informs Schindler that he's running a haven rather than a factory; the kindly but finally gutless industrialist, and a many dozen others, all unforgettable.And then there's Spielberg's damping down his usual sentimentality, his choice of Yiddish music for the soundtrack, his placement of the camera at a quiet and unobtrusive angle for the worst of evils - I found all of this pretty nearly perfect, but there were those who complained about the movie's historical inaccuracy.  In one scene, much noted for its supposed softening of the facts, Schindler's female \"employees\" find themselves in a big room with shower heads in the ceiling and actually get a shower instead of a flood of poison gas.  It's true that most prisoners were not so fortunate, and that such scenes may play into the hands of the filth who claim that there was no cyanide in the camps, but I can't see that as an argument against this movie.  If nothing else, the looks of tension on the women's faces before the water comes down is more than enough to tell us what they expect to get.After all, Spielberg is not a documentarian, he's a storyteller; this story could not have had a better servant.  The meaning of the Holocaust is as plain as plain here, particularly at the end when Schindler realizes that he could have saved a few more human beings if he had just thought to sell his car or his gold Nazi pin.  He crumples weeping to his knees, only to be lifted up by the men and women he has saved.A little later we learn that the descendants of Schindler's Jews living in Israel outnumber the entire current Jewish population of Poland.  That silences all criticism, as the movie audience already knew.

This film is without a doubt, the\nBest film that Spielberg has ever made. With many other Steven\nSpielberg's classics like Jurassic Park,Jaws,E.T, Raider of the Lost\nArk, Saving Private Ryan, etc. Schindler's List will always be Steven\nSpielberg's most finest, important film.

It stars Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, a German businessman in Poland who sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazis' rise to power. He starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using flattery and bribes to win military contracts, and brings in accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory. By staffing his plant with Jews who've been herded into Krakow's ghetto by Nazi troops, Schindler has a dependable unpaid labor force. For Stern, a job in a war-related plant could mean survival for himself and the other Jews working for Schindler. However, in 1942, all of Krakow's Jews are assigned to the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp, overseen by Commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), an embittered alcoholic who occasionally shoots prisoners from his balcony. Schindler arranges to continue using Polish Jews in his plant, but, as he sees what is happening to his employees, he begins to develop a conscience. He realizes that his factory (now refitted to manufacture ammunition) is the only thing preventing his staff from being shipped to the death camps. Soon Schindler demands more workers and starts bribing Nazi leaders to keep Jews on his employee lists and out of the camps. By the time Germany falls to the allies, Schindler has lost his entire fortune and saved 1,100 people from likely death.  This plot is too incredible to describe, but if I were going to try, I would tell everyone thats its the story of two men, one a hero, and another a monster, and its about the hero who tricked the monster so he could save hundreds of Jews from being killed by the Nazi army, and how this one man became one of the greatest people in the history of the world, and this movie spared no expense to show us that.   Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes play two of some of the greatest roles and history, the hero and villain, the man who saved and the man who killed, and they both play their part perfectly.  Steven Spielberg has filmed three of some of my favorite films of all time, The Terminal, Saving Private Ryan, and this movie, and if I had to choose the best, there is no doubt in my mind this is on top.

I've been a big fan of Steven Spielberg ever since I was a child but this movie has catapulted him to becoming one of the best directors of all time or if I may say, the best director of all time. The cinematography was infallible. When I watched the movie, it was my first time to see a black-and-white film and I actually thought it would be \"boring\". A thought of Charlie Chaplin crossed my mind which was not-so-good for me. But the truth is, it really worked well and went along with the message the movie was trying to convey. \r\r          The film wasn't just about Oskar Schindler. It was about people who struggled to live amidst all the adversaries that wanted to crush them. It is a story of a race that faced near extinction. It is a story of a man who proved that in times of despondency, there could still be hope. I tried my best not to cry, but a movie like this was worth every drop of my tear. Some may say that my review was exaggerated, but actually, I even think I must apologize to the readers for limiting into words the awesomeness of Schindler's List.

The Godfather gets just about everything right in this compelling masterpiece that will be forever remembered and emulated, the godfather of modern films.

Al Pacino and Marlon Brando give stellar performances in their greatest movie ever. The amount of emotion in The Godfather is amazing too as the you clearly feel each character's emotion and are drawn into it. The moments staying forever in your mind because it is so amazing. The Godfather reinvents the way I look at movies, my view of them has changed forever as I see how masterful this film is. It crushes every other film, no other film will ever come close to knocking The Godfather off its pedestal of greatness. Flaws, this sounds mundane but I cannot say it any other way, there are like ZERO flaws in the film. I scrutinized but could not find any at all. The good aspects deeply mask the film's bad aspects so a perfect movie has been created in a sense, that is amazing. I have not given a movie a perfect 10 out of 10, I have not seen a movie worthy of the all-time high but that changes with The Godfather and it is well deserved.

A combination of writing, acting, cinematography and a thoroughly engrossing plot have undoubtedly created one of the greatest pieces of cinema, point blank. A mixture of drama, thrill, crime and even comic value have been masterfully scripted into a film so full of suspense and charm that it undeniably crosses the mind of ever film fanatic or casual movie lover out there. Each and every scene of the film is carefully filmed to create a whole different world for the viewer to get involved in, these scenes are intense, personal, but most importantly, completely focused on who is onscreen, each character has their moment, and they each make their mark on this legendary film. Perhaps the man who left the biggest mark was Marlon Brando, who plays the titular character, an underworld crime family boss who we are introduced to as an over the shoulder view, he scratches his face with the back of his fingers, he rolls his eyes, strokes his cat and talks in a muffled tone, all through the brilliance of Brando, who used cotton wool to perfect the speech, and rolled with a cat running on set, something not scripted, but perfect for the character Brando created, the everlasting memory of Vito Corleone, a man that when he opens his mouth, a respectable silence falls upon the film, acting at its best. We are at his daughters wedding as the film opens, from this there is a message set for the film, family, a man who doesn't spend time wit his family can never be a man\" says Vito, one of the many quotes which made the film so memorable, but it also shows the true heart of the film, each of the sons this man has fathered look out for each other and all take part in the family 'business'. This business is told as a memorable reflection from Michael, played in perfectly calm but conflicted fashion by Al Pacino, who is the family member not quite sure what he wants, not part of the business, but suited for it. We are immediately thrust into the struggles of each crime family as they attempt to get stakes in a new market, something which Vito refuses to be a part of, put also something that almost costs him his life. With this, the eldest and hot-headed son steps forward, Sonny (James Caan) who ignores the wishes of the consigliere Tom (Robert Duvall) and seeks revenge on those who wronged his family. In the midst of all this there is a warming tone of a film, with some truly touching performances and some unforgettable turns as gangsters in 1940s New York. James Caan is well casted as the good-naturedbut short-tempered Sonny, who wants power, but also seems to want whats best for most of his family. But its Al Pacino and Marlon Brando who excel the film to remarkable achievements, Brando creates a character that simply couldn't be replicated or remade, and Pacino plays a conflicted but right-minded youngest brother, he gets what he wants and Pacino shows excellence in his eyes and confident speaking. A true journey of emotion, heartache, acceptance and love, the film explores all areas of what it means to be true to oneself, but also to forgive and forget, this is a truly remarkable feat and a masterful film that has given us some of the most memorable characters we have ever known, but also set a standard in the film industry as a force to be reckoned with, even as the years since its release tick on.", :useful=>[0.0, 0], :username=>"StevenF", :date=>"Aug  7, 2013", :location=>nil, :title=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"metacritic", :url=>"http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-godfather"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"Films like The Godfather are the reason i have a lifelong passion and love for film.", :clean_text=>"films like the godfather are the reason i have a lifelong passion and love for film.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"A combination of writing, acting, cinematography and a thoroughly engrossing plot have undoubtedly created one of the greatest pieces of cinema, point blank.

It's a great story, with a superstar cast, which set the genre for all the mafia films that followed, but that in and of itself means the film is going to have problems. As with other mafia films, it's difficult to keep track of who's who in the large cast. It also moves rather quickly and viewers like myself are going to have a very difficult time of trying to follow the erratic timeline of the film. Some parts move at a snails pace, while other just fly by, and what is with the music? The soundtrack is almost as acclaimed as the film, but honestly if I had to hear that song one more time, during this three hour epic, I may have gone out and killed someone myself. For those unfamiliar with the story, it follows the evolution of the Corleone family, as they transition from one leader to the next. The story is fantastic and is the furthest thing from predictable that you will ever find. It is filed with classic scenes and renowned performance from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, but I really have a hard time calling such a complicated story with that much violence, the best of all-time.

About the legend Marlon Brando,he is just phenomenal,his facial expressions and husky voice just make his role one of the best characters. It is based on Mario Puzo's novel about five fictional mafia families and Must say he did a great job on screenplay too. There are some great as well as shocking scenes in this movie i.e. When Woltz wake up and finds a real severed head of a horse. Sonny beats up his brother-in-law Carlo. Prolonged fight between Connie and Carlo. Death of Apollonia Vitelli-Corleone. Death scene of Sonny ambushed by gang members at toll. The killings of all the other heads of Mafia families,Moe Green,Tesiso and Carlo. I loved the setting and style. James Caan,Richard S. Castellano,Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton & Talia Shire did great jobs too. Despite the many Anachronisms,this movie is just marvellous. I have read everything that Coppola dis to make this movie so outstanding. Maybe the best gangster movie ever made.

Alliances are formed in secret, murders are plotted, enemies are butchered or blown to pieces without remorse. Don Vito (Marlon Brando) and his sons Sonny (James Caan) and Michael (Al Pacino) are the main characters. The actors bringing them to life have succeeded in their jobs so supremely that these characters have become the stuff of legend. Don Vito's backstory from the novel was pushed into The Godfather Part II, and that was a practical decision as the movie was already three hours long. Sonny and Michael display their acumen for running criminal activities when the reins are handed to them in their turn. Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is the consigliere, or the most trusted adviser, of the Don. We are transported from 1940s NYC ripe with Mafia bosses one-upping each other, to Sicily and Las Vegas. The characters are never shown to traverse great expanses of land or sea in search of destiny or whatever. Neither are they shown to be engaging in life-or-death situations where they have to come out on top using their wits or physical strength or endurance. But the change of settings does meet the requirements of the epic genre. Even though we don't get to see large scale gunfights or something like that, the fact that the Corleones are in all these places helps to form that opinion. The story is essentially about a single family, and you get the impression that the message here is that family is important, and that the lengths you're willing to go to to protect them knows no bounds. The Corleones' peace is fazed when a gangster offers them a deal in drugs. Don Vito expresses his disgust and refuses. This triggers an unexpected ploy for gaining power and upper hand and turns the conflict into a fully fledged gang war. Some characters are displaced, forced to take up arms, or caught in the crossfire. Another calamity strikes when things seem to have cooled down. Finally, the Corleones deal with their enemies effectively and ruthlessly. The victory is theirs, but if it is worth it is for the audience to decide. The Godfather's success lies in its rich story and characters. Often times, great stories come about by accident. The setting complements the plot and the characters, and becoming a character itself, creates a blend that is greater than the sum of its parts. These characters and plot could quite easily have worked in a medieval setting of dynasties warring for control over a kingdom, or any other setting for that matter, but the fact that the setting was New York City and the control over the city meant control over the most lucrative criminal activities, which is a decadent scheme, and immediately paints even the good guys in a bad light, was what in my opinion made The Godfather much more intriguing and enduring. There are many enemies to deal with. The film doesn't develop them at all. The Corleones are the only ones who are explored and developed as characters. At first it seems like it is a story of a group of people who have virtually everything they could ever want and the film would only chronicle their exploits as they vanquish this enemy and that. This changes as we move forward and witness the bloodshed. No good movie can come into being without good plotting, believable characterization, classy cinematography and memorable dialogue, and here it is all brought together nigh perfectly. The production design was impressive. The houses and their interiors, and the cars and costumes were fascinating and left me with a desire to be able to witness that world firsthand. The secondary characters may not have seemed to be given much screen time to develop them but the cast is so huge that if they had done it the movie would have been at least an hour longer. The score is so simple and true to the story that you don't need me to tell you that it may be the most memorable score ever. A lot of time is spent in contemplation and silence, as the characters decide what the best course of action should be in response to a particular problem. The dialogue fleshes out the characters very well. The Godfather is essentially a film that looks into the lives of the gangsters at the top of the hierarchy. We only see the comings and goings, and not the handiwork, of the men who carry out the orders of their bosses. No shootouts during the gang war are shown. The intrigue that directly affects the main characters is in itself so destructive and deadly that not once the exclusion of the ordinary mobsters bother me in any way. The Godfather cannot be dismissed as being merely about a mob family and a bunch of criminals. Given his later career, I think it's safe to venture that Coppola was born to make this movie.", :useful=>[0.0, 0], :username=>"Swati", :date=>"Mar  6, 2014", :location=>nil, :title=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"metacritic", :url=>"http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-godfather"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"Inspired by the Five Families of New York City, The Godfather tells the story of how the Corleones are pushed against the wall by their rivals and other upcoming gangsters who want to make money by sources Don Vito deems beneath him, and their retaliation and its consequences.

Two years later, this film adaptation appeared and I have since seen it (as well as Godfather Part II) more than a dozen times. Francis Ford Coppola deserves all of the praise and awards these films have received over the years. He should also be admired for insisting that Pacino and Brando be cast in two of the major roles despite strong opposition from Paramount. Coppola assembled a superb cast but also an equally talented crew. Those who share my high regard for it no doubt have their own favorite scenes. Mine include Michael's enlistment of a bewildered young man's assistance at the hospital until members of the Corleone family arrive to protect their don, the sequence in the restaurant which results in the killing of Sollozzo and McCluskey, Tom Hagen's discussion with Jack Woltz during dinner, Michael's reunion conversation with Kay as they stroll in a New England village, and the montage of executions during the baptism. None of the extensive violence in the film seems gratuitous. Each major character is fully developed. The cinematography and score are outstanding, although neither was even nominated for an Academy Award. Dark as this film often is, it also has its lighter moments, as during the wedding celebration when Luca Brasi rehearses his remarks before presenting a gift and later when Clemenza teases Michael good-naturedly about Kay Adams. For me, the single most interesting element in the film is Michael's gradual development from his family's baby brother (albeit a war hero) to its ruthlessly efficient don. Once he volunteers to kill Sollozzo and McCluskey, his destiny is assured.

Any doubt about that can be dispelled by watching the movie. I missed this when it first came out, and then a curious thing happened. For some reason I thought I had seen the film. One decade and then two went by and I kept hearing what a great film The Godfather was. But I was unimpressed because I thought I had seen it.I don't know what film I had seen, but it wasn't The Godfather. Seeing this film for the first time over thirty years after the fact of its production is a startling experience. The Godfather is a work of art from first scene to last. There is the most amazing adherence to that fiction which is truer than fact.I would like to say that I played cards with Mario Puzo who wrote the novel from which the film was adapted and who famously worked with Coppola on the screenplay, but in fact I only played cards with some people who had played cards with Puzo. Ah, such is the effect of celebrity. Puzo became like Coppola something of a legend after this film was produced, and everybody suddenly knew him or played cards with him. Everybody, from the most unsophisticated celluloid fan to the most erudite and jaded critic had walked out of that theater after 171 minutes mesmerized and delighted and emotionally moved by an uncompromising look at not just a Mafia family, but the psychology of families since time immemorial. The truth that we have all lived and experienced was made large on the screen in the form of the Corleones. I can guarantee you that audiences from every culture on the planet would understand the underlying psychology of this movie and take it to some serious extent as their own.Marlon Brando plays the godfather (the patriarch, of course, or even the warlord if you like) of the past and the present, and then, as must always be the case, comes a new godfather. What is fascinating is who this new godfather is and how he comes to power. The ending of the film is--after so many brilliant scenes and so many psychologically true surprises and so many excursions to Queens and the Bronx and Sicily and Las Vegas (each vignette absolutely integrated into the story of the film)--even more ponderously true and a surprise that sneaks up on us so stealthily that it is not a surprise. And when the credits begin to run after Diana Keaton's tears of realization, we too realize the \"message\" of the film. It is a message that I think would be understood in the Middle East today (and two thousand years ago as well) as I write this, a message of tribal ways and the rise and fall of warlords and the Machiavellian machinations of the prince who would be king.But it is Al Pacino's performance as the son of the godfather that in the final analysis steals the show as he goes from the intellectual boy who would be a legitimate American success at the finest colleges, etc. to a man wearing the hat of Al Capone. And Pacino makes us believe every step of the way.Well, I should not say that it Al Pacino who steals the show. In truth this is Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece. He would not have the film he has without Al Pacino or Marlon Brandon and certainly not without the novel and script from Mario Puzo, of course; but make no mistake about it. Coppola manicured every scene. He attended to every detail, from the color of the wine to the tires on the cars to the dances and the music to the villas abroad to the sleaze of Las Vegas to the perfect casting of the main characters right down to the extras including both cute and not so cute kids, as indeed life would give us. In some very real sense Coppola lived this movie and it was a part of him, and yet I am stuck by the fact that Puzo invented it.This is an American classic, an uncompromising work of art that engages, informs and moves the audience--just about any audience--to ask the great questions regarding who we are and what we should do and how we should live. From the wedding to the funeral to the christening to the priest in Latin voice-over as the final vengeance is planned to that final vengeance (that we know will NOT be the final vengeance), we are glued to our seats as the life of human beings (who could very well be us) passes before our transfixed eyes.Oscars went to Brando as best actor, and to Puzo and Coppola for best screen adaptation. In a rare show of almost universal agreement among movie goers, critics, and the Academy, The Godfather won the Oscar as Best Picture in 1972.Don't miss this as I had for so long, and see it for

It may not have been the slickest piece of film-making or broke any new ground but it's themes, the importance of family, both biological and professional, resonate to this day.  In this case the families happen to be both Italian-American and Mafia, but that's just incidental.  I've never read the novel that this is based on but it's my understanding that Mario Puzo's book is pulpier than than the film that Francis Ford Coppola made of it.  That is one of the reasons that this film is elevated above all others in that it could have been soapier and glitzier than it was but it did not succumb to that and credit has to be given to Coppola as both screenwriter and director for that.  Coppola emphasized in his script it's most important theme, family, and concentrated on developing characters instead of stereotypes.  Yes, some people remember the more violent and sensational aspects of this film.  We also know the people in this film.  The Corleone's are as familiar to us as either are own family or neighbors.  Marlon Brando gives an appropriately subdued performance here as Don Vito Corleone.  His character seems melancholic and rueful, seeming to be mourning his situation in life or the changing ways of his chosen way of life, yet accepts the reality and the responsibilities that come for a man in his position.  Al Pacino in his second film, his first being the little seen \"Panic in Needle Park\", is dynamic as Michael, the son that the Don wanted better things for but because of changing circumstance is drawn into the family business.  Michael is to prove that he is more than up to the challenge of settling scores.  James Caan as Sonny, the heir apparent to the Don who may be a little to emotional and hot-headed for the job, does tremendous work here.  Robert Duvall is also good in the role of Tom Hagen, adopted son of the Corleones, who acts as lawyer for the family's business.  It also should be noted that John Cazale appears here as Fredo, the ineffectual Corleone son.  Fredo's character isn't really developed until the second installment of this saga but I would like to note that Cazale, who died young in 1978 but made the most of his short life.  Besides appearing in the first two \"Godfather\" films he also appeared and was quite effective in \"The Conversation\", \"Dog Day Afternoon\", and \"The Deer Hunter\", released after his death.  There are may other great actors (Talia Shire, Richard Castellano, etc.) so numerous who do good work here.  Some would feel that \"The Godfather\" is a romanticized depiction of the Mafia but I don't see that as the case.  \"The Godfather\" is a good story whose milieu is incidentally in the world of organized crime.  On a final note, Coppola contributes an excellent and very informative commentary to the film on the DVD that enhances the viewing of the film particularly for those who've seen it numerous times.",

Then I retrieved Mario Puzo's novel from my book collection and plowed through it, savoring and relishing this extraordinary piece of literature that had such an impact on our cultural landscape thirty-plus years ago.Francis Ford Coppola's THE GODFATHER is a triumphant, magnificent screen portrayal of Puzo's epic book.  The story of an Italian-American mob \"family\" entrenched in inherent and often desperate violence, Coppola weaves this film with compelling, moving, and haunting visuals that are as beautiful as they are disturbing.  The scenes are at once simplistic and complex, yet such a dichotomy is not lost on the viewer, but embraced--appreciated for its overwhelming genius.I've seen more than my fair share of Marlon Brando films, and in my opinion the character of Don Vito Corleone is this actor's signature role.  Brando effectively portrays the Godfather's compassion, love and devotion to his family, and calm acumen to make \"business\" decisions that literally mean life or death to countless men.  Don Vito is both a family man and a killer:  two seemingly inconsistent characteristics that make Brando's portrayal even more remarkable.  The rest of the cast, including James Caan and Robert Duvall, is exceptional, but it is Al Pacino as young Michael Corleone--Don Vito's \"baby boy\" who was not meant to enter the family business--who provides the most telling role in this film.  Before our very eyes, we see Michael change from a man eager to remain at arms-length to the Corleone family ventures to a ruthless, cold-blooded Godfather himself--a transformation both astounding and eery.THE GODFATHER is a feast of unforgettable cinematic moments:  from an ambush at a toll booth to a bloody horse head wrapped in satin sheets.

the few films in which I personally did not find\nany\nsignificant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the\nacting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic\nwritten all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now\nconsidered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it\ncomes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary\nas\nCitizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a\nmovie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for\n\"gangster movies\", but its influence goes well beyond that.The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements\nof\nit can be found in virtually every \"organized crime film\" nowadays; almost\nevery comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed\nsomething in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito\nCorleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's\nimagination.But to say that The Godfather is simply \"influential\" is to diminish its\ntrue qualities, and so is to describe it simply as \"a movie about\ngangsters\". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves\naround\n(despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the\nmovie\nnever tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of\npsychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked.\nConsiderations\non how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear\ndifferent from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a\nhuman\nsoul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a\nstory that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the\nresult\nis a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to\nconsider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic\ntriumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever\nappear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in\nportraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a\nslip.\nThe exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively\nby\nMarlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan\nand Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the\nruthless\nVirgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other\nroles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us\nbelieve these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a\ncentral character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around\nhim:\nalthough Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time,\neverybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it\npossible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to\nobserve how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more\neffectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in\nthe\nlast few years.The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie\n(Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the\nuse of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his\nlife. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's\npower extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely\npopular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless\nkiller,\nDon Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him\nback. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence\nand\nintuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger\npeople\nworking in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete.\nThe Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too\ndangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up\nself-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a\nlong time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close\none\neye. Drugs are another thing.To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while\nmaintaining\nhis economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a\npowerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don\nCorleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by\nthe latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see\nMichael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take\npart in the family business, lose his \"innocence\" and transform into a\ngangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up\nagainst.I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe\nthat\nthe film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and --\nbelieve it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never\nseen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an\nincredible tension, various twists, and although like any other\nmasterpiece\nThe Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still\nbe\na phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for\nthe\nfirst time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such\ncomplicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short\nreview like this one would be inadmissible.There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel\nwritten by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an exposé\nof\ntrue facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for\ninstance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other\ncharacters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that: frankly,\nI\nhave no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra\nreference seems obviously quite believable.The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are\nused perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a\nfair\namount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is\nuniversally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances\nby\nPacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.\n\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb",

A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like\nthis film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This\nwas until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for\nthis sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read)\nevery last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I\ngrew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients\nworking in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across\nthis, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters:\nGood films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat\nbecause the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want\nmono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish\ncontrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes\nfilms deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the\nDon's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas\nSonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply\nhaving these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do\nis to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then\ndwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in.\nThe Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many\ntry to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character\nobscurities that stretch credibility.2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a\ntransformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the\nend of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's\ncharacter must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must\nalso have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the\nwedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film.\nAgain, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal\n(literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall\nStreet).3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple\nreason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was\nnot much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the\nnew goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family\nlife, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the\nkey (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with\nWolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While\nstudios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it\nif you have a ripper story to base it on.I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous\nre-watch-ability.\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"\nThis is a masterpiece.", :clean_text=>"this is a masterpiece.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"A timeless masterpiece.", :clean_text=>"a timeless masterpiece.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>2, :text=>"Initially, I didn't like\nthis film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring.", :clean_text=>"initially i didn't like this film all that much i found it rather over-hyped and boring.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{:length=>50}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>3, :text=>"This\nwas until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for\nthis sort of film: subtitles.", :clean_text=>"this was until the advent of dvd which gave me the feature i needed for this sort of film subtitles.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>4, :text=>"Once I switched them on and heard (read)\nevery last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I\ngrew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients\nworking in near perfect harmony.", :clean_text=>"once i switched them on and heard read every last word of brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings i grew a true appreciation for this epic.to make a true epic you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{:plot=>25, :credibility=>40}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>5, :text=>"For screenwriters who come across\nthis, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters:\nGood films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat\nbecause the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want\nmono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish\ncontrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes\nfilms deep, meaningful and grand.", :clean_text=>"for screenwriters who come across this take the following pointers on board 1 contrasting characters good films have some character distinction but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.of course there are exceptions to rule ie where you want mono-tonal characters aka matrix or where you want outlandish contrasts aka the fifth element but ultimately this is what makes films deep meaningful and grand.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{:plot=>100}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>6, :text=>"Consider the contrasts between the\nDon's children.", :clean_text=>"consider the contrasts between the don's children.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>7, :text=>"Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas\nSonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded.", :clean_text=>"michael is rather cool rational and collected whereas sonny is more hot-headed spontaneous and simple minded.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>8, :text=>"But simply\nhaving these contrasts is not nearly enough.", :clean_text=>"but simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough.", :sentiment=>0, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>9, :text=>"What you really need to do\nis to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then\ndwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in.", :clean_text=>"what you really need to do is to develop these characters place them in situations and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in.", :sentiment=>-1, :context_tags=>{:plot=>100}, :emphasis=>1.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>10, :text=>"The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off.

The first time I\nviewed 'The Godfather' I was in my early teens and it was the most\nastounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my\nall-time favourite film. It is due to this that I have been looking\nforward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So let's\nstart from the beginning. The film opens to four words, 'I believe in\nAmerica', it's crazy to think that this simple line has become a\nresonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the\nfilm's \"threshold\". This is just one of the many renowned quotes that\nlitter the film, and believe me, there are a lot. After the first take\nwe are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantly\nportrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando. Vito is a\nfeared man, he is a criminal, he is a mafioso, but above all he is a\nrespected family man, his three sons are depicted by three excellent\nactors, James Caan, John Cazale and Al Pacino as well as his adopted\nchild Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall. The film follows Vito as he\nattempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son, Michael.\nWith some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have ever\nbeen seen in the 1970's film industry (including a certain horse's\nhead), 'The Godfather' epitomises how violence can be used effectively\nwithin a film. The Corleone's are some of the greatest antiheroes to\nhave ever been seen on screen, whilst they are villains, the audience\nwill refuse to accept that fact, Coppola does something simple and\naudacious, he takes the guilt out of organised crime. A film rife with\nbeautiful cinematography, memorable musical scores and well-paced\naction and drama. Overall, The Godfather is one of Hollywood's greatest\ncritical and commercial successes that gets everything right; a\ngangster flick that is overflowing with life, rich with emotion and\nsubtle acting, and further blessed with amazing direction from Francis\nFord Coppola.

:useful=>"Super Reviewer", :date=>"January 16, 2010", :rating=>5, :percentage=>100.0, :content=>"It's hard to judge a film like 'The Godfather', especially for someone of my generation. Since its release in 1972, The Godfather has accrued a legendary status; it's difficult to watch a film that is often touted as the best of all time with an open mind and no preconceptions. However, after watching The Godfather many times and reading the novel on which it was based upon, it's clearly something very special. The film is a sprawling epic that rewards the viewer with a savagely twisting, multi-faceted plot. It's a mobsters' coming of age tale that's laced with marriage, favours, family, betrayal, tragedy, violence and death.  Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is introduced on the day of his daughter's wedding, a very special day in Sicilian tradition where the father of the bride is to deny no man a special favour. The beneficiaries' utmost respect for the Don is illustrated in the opening stanza, their displays of courtesy coming in the form of personal address and greeting rituals.  The Don is a man of respect and principle, a man who puts emphasis on what's fair, denying to avenge, for example,  a father's anguish over the rape of his daughter by means of murder - 'That is not justice; your daughter's still alive'. In other circles however; the Don is not so respected. Vito Corleone is an old fashioned Don, what is referred to as a 'Moustache Pete'; he is reluctant to delve into the business of drugs, unlike the contemporaries from the rival New York crime families. The Don's refusal turns the relationship between the Corleones and many of the other families sour. It is how the ensuing violence is regarded as just 'business' that is the cold, harsh danger of the film. Its depiction of violence is visceral and often occurs when not expected. Rather quickly, the Corleone criminal empire falls apart; the next generation having to revitalise the family and reclaim their place at the top of the five families.The film is perfectly cast; the primary characters of Vito (Marlon Brando), Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Fredo (John Cazale), Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) and Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) are all expertly interpreted from Mario Puzo's magnum opus. The scores of supporting actors are also without fault; it's a true acting showcase. After reading the novel, it's remarkable how faithfully envisioned the characters are in the film, which is thanks to a combination of physicality and astute interpretation.The Godfather is a brilliant adaptation of Mario Puzo's masterfully told story; the 1969 novel was written with such an authenticity that it almost seems like non-fiction in certain passages. I think it's true that when one thinks of a gangster, they picture the omnipotent Vito Corleone sitting back in his chair, his glum face contemplating with that infinite sagacity and authority. The Godfather is a true spectacle in both mediums; deciding which is best is a difficult task. The only aspect that I felt was stronger in the book was character development. The character of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is given greater depth in the novel; Michael's transcendence seeming comparatively abrupt in the celluloid interpretation. The character of Luca Brasi is abundantly more powerful in the book, whom whilst is an ally of the Corleone family, is penned as an ominous nemesis with a dark, brutal secret. The film, meanwhile, essentially depicts Brasi as an oaf; he is a far less intimidating figure. Additionally, many of the supporting characters are also given interesting back stories by Puzo, notably Captain McCluskey. Of course, that level of intricacy is possible in a novel, while a film could easily become bloated with such detailing. Ultimately, 'The Godfather' is a film made by a highly talented crew who combined the seminal prose of a skilled author with brilliant direction, perfect performances, effective cinematography and the utterly beautiful, distinctive music of Nino Rota and Carlo Savina to produce one of the best, well rounded and moving films ever made. It is a film that is wholly deserving of the term 'required viewing'.", :title=>nil, :location=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"rotten_tomatoes", :url=>"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/godfather/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"It's hard to judge a film like 'The Godfather', especially for someone of my generation.", :clean_text=>"it's hard to judge a film like the godfather especially for someone of my generation.", :sentiment=>2, :context_tags=>{}, :emphasis=>0.0, :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[]}, {:index=>1, :text=>"Since its release in 1972, The Godfather has accrued a legendary status;

Mario Puzoâ(TM)s The Godfather is one of those films that is perfect. Being based of off the best seller by Mario Puzo, director Francis Ford Coppola creates one of the most accurate portrayals of an Italian crime family. When most people think about films that deal with the Mafia, Italian gangsters, what they think about is people that ship drugs, deal with prostitution, and above all else, just fight others for the hell of it. But, what makes The Godfather so different is that, contrary to the rather dark, violent nature of the film, this movie destroys all stereo types as it becomes a film that is not, at all, about running a crime family. This film is REALLY about a father trying to pass his legacy and empire to one of his sons and that one son having to come to terms with his own legacy and the choices he makes. When Mario Puzo decided to originally write the novel that this film is based on, he did it only for the money and nothing else. But what he did not expect was to have his entire creation take a complete life of itâ(TM)s own in a way that only few people can imagine. Even more so was the shock of how well this film did. Want a little taste of how well this film did? Before the film was even released, The Godfather Part II was already in development. But, more on that later. Now, my complete reaction to watching this film. To say that this is one of my personal favorite films of all time would be something of a drastic understatement. With me, there are some films that you like and some that change your life. This is one of those films that changes your life with each and every viewing. When I first sat down and watched this film, I remember feeling complete once the credits started to role. I know that sounds cheap, but it is true. Everything from the story to they way â~Donâ(TM) Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is in this film, it just spoke to me in a way that very few films can ever do. And I am not the only one that felt this way. There is a magic in this movie that can never be paralleled and the closes that we get (and one that is pretty damn close at that) is the sequel that is said to be equal to better then this film. But more on that later. Letâ(TM)s get down to the details. With direction, Coppola does wonders. He keeps the story moving, never dragging behind, and keeps making you interested with the look of the film. While some have complained about the lighting used as being too dark of a film or too gold, I say that the use of that is, quite fantastic. The reason why is because it always sets the mood for the scene and the tone that you will end up feeling. Plus, little added in items like the use of oranges in some scenes give this film a little kick by letting the audience know that something is about to go down. For the direction, Coppola, you do wonders. And the Academy Award for Best Direction was well won and deserved. Now the acting. Oh, my God. What can I say? Well, letâ(TM)s think. Marlon Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor and Al Pacino won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Need I say more? Okay, I will talk about the supporting cast. With huge names like Richard Dreyfus, James Caan, Abe Vigoda, and Diane Keaton, this film is filled with some of the greatest talent that money can buy. But what shocks me the most is that they treat this film with such a tone of seriousness that they literally stop becoming themselves and become these incredible people. Next the score. Like so many classic films, this filmâ(TM)s score is something of a staple in film history. Mostly due to the famous â~The Godfather Waltzâ(TM), Nina Rota became a household name in the music world due to the simplicity of that piece. It was simple, yet set the tone perfectly. The only crime that has ever been done on this film was the score not being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score. Oh well. Later on, this film saga will get itâ(TM)s award. Finally the script. Being adapted from the novel by Mario Puzo, and being written by him and Coppola, this film mirrors the novel so closely that you would only have to read the novel to know more about the extra characters that are not THAT huge. The dialogue is authentic, honest, and bold as this well written script is presented. The Academy Award for Best adapted Screen play was also well deserved. Overall, this entire film is worthy of the magnitude that it has gotten, the awards it has won (including Best Film), and the hearts and souls it has touched. Easily one of the greatest films ever made.", :title=>nil, :location=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"rotten_tomatoes", :url=>"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/godfather/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0,
