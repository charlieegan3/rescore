{:content=>"After having temporarily staved off a vicious assault, Justin Long's character shakily asks his savior if he's done stuff like that before and if he's killed someone before, to which John McClane's laconic response is \"Not for a long time.\" And, indeed, it's been 12 long years since DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE. John McClane is now older, balder, grumpier, and, saddled with a PG-13 rating, not as profane, but he still cannot stay out of trouble. This time, he's assigned the seemingly mundane task of escorting in young hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long), who's wanted for questioning. But the situation quickly sours as, within moments of meeting Farrell, McClane begins to hear that oh-so-familiar melody of automatic gunfire directed at their noggins.Both McClane and the frail but side-of-the-mouth funny computer geek speedily realize that Farrell's fringe involvement is merely the very tip of the iceberg, and that the stakes are much, much higher. Turns out that the contractor who'd hired Farrell to do a simple, innocuous code work is scheming to hold the entire nation hostage with his own paralyzing brand of cyber terrorism. Soon, the systematical shutdown of the American infrastructure is underway as, basically, all things computerized become compromised. This includes the targeting and usurping of key establishments such as the FAA, Amtrak, the stock market, and our satellite communications system. But, for Los Angelinos like myself, the most insiduous act commited may have been the subversing of *gasp* the street traffic lights.For the now grizzled John McClane, nothing much has changed. He's a Lieutenant Detective now, so he's kind of moved up in the world. And he still has those perpetually pursed lips. But his personal life is predictably very much of a mess. He's alone again, divorced (with his ex-wife Holly gone back to using her Gennero surname) and estranged from his children. The start of the film has McClane pathetically attempting to keep tabs on his wilful and sullen daughter, Lucy Gennero (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). But she wants none of his reconciliatory gestures. Not to mention, McClane's an anachronistic type who clings to classic rock music and who is computer unsavvy. Good thing he's got a hacker in his custody.It's such a treat to watch Bruce Willis again be in his element and playing this iconic role. Not that Entertainment Weekly has the final say, but I do agree with the magazine's listed assessment of Die Hard (Widescreen Edition) as being the top action film ever (ALIENS was number 2, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was number 3). Nowadays, Willis, at 52 years old, is not as spry or free with the smirks. But his physicality, even at this stage, can't be questioned as he suffered bruises and scars in the making of this film. As McClane, he still trounces bad guys with the best of 'em. But, more so than McClane's penchant for arse whoopin', what draws the audience to him is that aura of reluctance, world weariness, and doggedness which he exudes so naturally. We relate to this ordinary, blue collar cat who, time and again, becomes stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time and is forced to angrily muddle thru because there's no one else to do the job. Although LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD portrays McClane as more of a supercop this time, who can go one on one with an F-35 fighter jet and murder an assault chopper with a car, I still fondly remember the first film, in which McClane passed muster as a very likable everyday guy barely keeping it together in Nakatomi Plaza. John McClane has built up so much good will that I'm able to easily forgive - and even celebrate - the high octane and wildly improbable excesses here.Justin Long, dubiously best known as the Mac guy in the Apple computer ad campaigns, gets his number called for sidekick duties, and he does a good job, although there were times where his trembly act got to be too much. His Matt Farrell may be a borderline computer felon but his heart's in the right place. Long gets to make the brunt of the wisecracks while McClane tersely motors along (he says to some fellow geeks who'd just blown his cover, \"Good luck at the Bad Timing Awards.\"). One failing of the film is the lack of a charismatic villain. Timothy Olyphant is unmemorable as former Homeland Security computer whiz Thomas Gabriel, whose mission is to digitally teach the nation and his ex-bosses a lesson while garnering sinful financial amounts. There's nothing fresh or arresting about Olyphant's acting performance, which basically consists of a whole lot of staring really hard. But, admittedly, it's fun to witness Gabriel's ever growing exasperation as McClane persists in surviving. Maggie Q does better as the evil hot Asian babe who's also a formidable martial artist. Her character Mai proves to be pretty resilient (but, ultimately, not resilient enough). Writer and maverick director Kevin Smith gets a chance to mug for the camera as the Warlock (or Freddy, to his mom), a jedi hacker whose base of operations is in his mother's basement. Bonnie Bedelia, by the way, is sorely missed, and the film would've benefited with more scenes between McClain and his surly daughter.LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is primed to be a colossal summer blockbuster, and, as such, it has certain criteria it has to meet. Director Len Wiseman (the UNDERWORLD films) comes strong and full bore with great visuals, a relentless pace, implausible action sequences, and crazy pyrotechnics. And all this performed at raucous, senses shattering decibels. The stunts are mindblowing, keeping in mind that CG effects were kept to a minimum. These are flesh and bone stunts being done here. But, still, at the heart of the loud thrill-a-minutes, there is Bruce Willis keeping it all together with his signature McClane-isms. I still get a vast kick out of his un-PC chortling whenever he causes yet another bad guy's demise (oh, that poor, agile-as-a-monkey French dude). As always, to me, his mockery of death, in a way, adds a layer of realism as this has become McClane's way of ackowledging his vulnerability and celebrating his surviving yet another harrowing scrape. LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is PG-13, but the film finds ways to circumvent the rating as the ever resourceful McClane continues to cuss (but minus the \"F\" word) and ad-lib his way to amassing an impressive body count.

Now,with the assistance of Matt Farrell,it is up to John McClane to save America(as well as his own daughter)by defeating Thomas Gabriel and going through some of the detrimental and fearful obstacles that he has encountered before(need I say when and how?)with success,intelligence,and an appropriate amount of style.\"Live Free or Die Hard\" is a top-notch film that fits perfectly into the \"Die Hard\" series. \"Live Free or Die Hard\" successfully recaptures the action and suspense that one got out of \"Die Hard\",while succeeding in the action and suspense not recycling the action and suspense that was in DH,and at the same time,keeping everything entertaining. There is plenty of comedy in \"Live Free or Die Hard\" that remains true to the comedy that you would find in any film that sits in the genres of comedy and action/comedy,without going overboard. To top it all off,\"Live Free or Die Hard\" allows itself to be straightforward and realistic. This is by \"Live Free or Die Hard\" being \"honest\" towards the kind of real life situation that it is dealing with,but at the same time,not choking on what is known as crime drama or becoming too much of a reality that people fear. Add all of this together,and you have an irreproachable film that carries the same beauty that \"Die Hard\" was able to carry. That beauty? A plausible(if you are able to look past some of the action sequences)film that successfully combines reality with action,never failing to entertain and successfully keeping itself from being a giddy action film.There are actually two unrated DVD versions of \"Live Free or Die Hard\" that are being released on DVD(the other two not being unrated). One two disc set,and one with only one disc. As we wait to learn ***all*** of the special feautures that will be on these two DVD versions of \"Live Free or Die Hard\"(which will be released on November 20),I recommend pre-ordering the two disc set(for more special feautures,unless you want to save money). But,either way,it doesn't really matter. Why? Because the unrated version of \"Live Free or Die Hard\" takes the theatrical version of LFDH and gives fans more of what they were hoping to get out of a non PG-13 rated version of \"Live Free or Die Hard\"!!!!Overall,the best film in the \"Die Hard\" series(in my opinion),and a DVD that remains true to the \"Die Hard\" series and gives \"Live Free or Die Hard\" and fans of the DH series what they really want and deserve--a proficient action film that is what it deserves to be,not an action film that is cleaned up(despite how good \"Live Free or Die Hard\" turned out to be and still is).",

:emphasis=>0.24}]}, {:content=>"It is worth noting that before \"Live Free or Die Hard\" was released, it actually had two complaints that it had to deal with: not only was it PG-13, the grandfather of the \"Die Hard\" series, John McTiernan (who directed \"Die Hard\" and \"Die Hard With a Vengeance\"; something that gave McTiernan the honor of directing all but one of the DH films before this was released), was MIA. Negative signs for a sequel, especially a sequel to a film that came out twelve years ago (\"Die Hard With a Vengeance\") and is a fourth film in a trilogy.But, none of the above hurts \"Live Free or Die Hard\" whatsoever. This time around, John McClane (Bruce Willis) is still a New York City police officer. While John McClane's police work has become easier, his personal life hasn't. This is due to the fact that John McClane is divorced from his wife Holly, and that his two children, Lucy (portrayed by Mary Elizabeth Winstead in this film) and John Jr. are not speaking to him (throughout this film, with the exception of a picture of the actress that played Holly McClane in \"Die Hard\" and \"Die Hard 2: Die Harder\", Bonnie Bedelia, being present, there is no sign of either Holly McClane or John McClane Jr. throughout this film).And then, one night, everything in John McClane's life turns around and makes a turn for the worse. Once John McClane has arrested a computer hacker by the name of Matt Farrell (Justin Long), before McClane knows it, he and Farrell are on the run. Now, not only is it up to John McClane to save the life of Matt Farrell(and before he knows it, his own daughter),he and Farell,before they know it, are up against Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olymphant),a dangerous man who has the computer infrastructure and the world at the tip of his fingers.Can John McClane not only defeat Thomas Gabriel, but at the same time, rescue his own daughter, Matt Farrell, and the entire nation? Or, will the power of Thomas Gabriel lead to Gabriel defeating both John McClane and the nation, and McClane's personal life and career being permanently scarred?The only things that will tell are time, decisions, and intelligence.So, what makes \"Live Free or Die Hard\" a strong addition to the \"Die Hard\" series? Based off of the article \"A Farewell to Arms\" by John Carlin,\"Live Free or Die Hard\" understands its limits. It avoids becoming too much of reality that several people fear every day, without trying to be light for that specific reason. In that matter, \"Live Free or Die Hard\" is straightforward and realistic, something that any type of film like itself needs. There is plenty of suspense and action in \"Live Free or Die Hard\" that is richly executed, and is able to remain true to its predecessors (\"Die Hard\",\" Die Hard 2:Die Harder\", and \"Die Hard With a Vengeance\"),without recycling them. At the same time, you will find classic humor that is to be found in \"Live Free or Die Hard\". This humor 1)never fails to entertain,2)fits in well the script, and 3)is suitable enough for \"Live Free or Die Hard\" to be a strong addition to the \"Die Hard\" films, without going overboard.The acting in \"Live Free or Die Hard\" is also another one of the film's highlights. The main actors of \"Live Free or Die Hard\"--Bruce Willis,Justin Long,Timothy Olymphant,and actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead--plus several others--perfectly understand the drama and emotion that their performance in \"Live Free or Die Hard\" requires, and execute it to their fullest. At the same time, Bruce Willis and Justin Long make a perfect onscreen team, while Willis, despite his age, NAILS the action that his fourth portrayal of John McClane requires.It is also worth noting that even though some people were angry/disappointed that John McTiernan did not direct \"Live Free or Die Hard\", the director of LFODH, Len Wiseman (who was hired as a replacement director for McTiernan, as a result of McTiernan having \"Three Kings\" and \"Batman Begins\" producer Charles Roven wiretapped and lying to FBI agents about it) serves as a perfect director for the film. Not only does Len Wiseman's direction of \"Live Free or Die Hard\" save the film from its PG-13 rating (in other words, Wiseman did a good job at making sure that LFORDH was not less intense by its rating, something that could have happened) and give it the suspense, emotion, action, and humor that it needed, there is something else worth noting.

However, the movie is unrated, not extended. The changes are all in the dialog. Some lines have been changed or removed all together. The \"that will wake the neighbors \" line is now removed, now jumping straight to the action instead of the pause. The \"I ran out of bullets\" line is now changed as well. There are alot of F***s and mother f*****s now replaced in the dialog. There is still some strange editing and weird syncs with the dubbing matching the actors mouths. There is more blood added and yes, Bruce does say his full catch phrase. The movie in my opinion, with everythig put back in, is much better. It feels even more like Die Hard than it did in theatres.

considered by many film buffs as the greatest action movie ever made. There is just something about the character of John McClane that attracts movie goers. Is it his spunky attitude or is it the fact that he is known for having really bad days? It's both. There have been action franchises that have run out of steam in the past, but all three Die Hard films were great fun. Usually I'm not a fan of dipping into the well one too many times, but if Batman Begins and Casino Royale were able to re-spark the magic then why not give Die Hard another go?Live Free Or Die Hard takes an old fashioned cop and throws him out of his element, which leaves room for a supporting character. Justin Long steps in as McClane's frazzled and tech wizard sidekick. Timothy Olyphant plays a cyber terrorist who decides to shutdown the entire nation in order to systematically collect hundreds of millions of bank account numbers in order to show the government that the system can in fact be broken. Now it's up to John McClane and his sidekick Matthew Farrell to save the day.What follows is high octane action that one expects from a Die Hard movie. An important thing to point out is how director Len Wiseman stayed true to the Die Hard style and kept CGI to a minimum. Die Hard movies were great because they did action using real stunts and real explosions. The one thing I was afraid of was that this new Die Hard would go with the trend and use CGI as a crutch when in fact it used it as a tool. There are plenty of stunts that are real sets and real explosions. A few scenes fallback on CGI, but only because doing them for real just wouldn't work. Bruce Willis also keeps the spunk that is John McClane. You'll laugh at the one-liners and the witty remarks that Willis adds in the tensest situations and of course Justin Long is just great with sarcasm. They make a great on-screen duo. I also think that the humor in the Die Hard series is what makes it such a great action series. It's the fact that the filmmakers realize they are making an action movie; a movie in which nothing could ever happen in real life. Lots of action movies take themselves too seriously and they become laughably bad, but Live Free Or Die Hard keeps that spunk that makes it laughably enjoyable. Don't get me wrong though; there are some amazing action scenes that will make you tense up. This is by no means a comedy. The elevator shaft scene was one that stood out and reminded me of the trailer hanging off the cliff in Spielberg's The Lost World.Moving onto the score this brings up Marco Beltrami. I can state here that I am not a Marco Beltrami fan. The only score of his that I liked was his score to The Three Burials Of Melquiades Estrada. I always feel like he never does anything thematic at all and which is why I was worried when he was selected to fill Michael Kamen's shoes. Michael Kamen was the composer of the first three Die Hard films, but sadly he passed away in 2003. He was a greatly respected composer and his work on the first three Die Hards were iconic. Thankfully Marco Beltrami rose to the occasion and did a wonderful tribute with his score to Live Free Or Die Hard. He touches on some themes that Kamen wrote and gives it that Die Hard feel and atmosphere.Overall this movie was great. I had a great time watching it and felt like it was better than most of the high budget stuff I've seen this summer so far. Sometimes we need to go back to the basics to remind us why we love what we love.

It belongs to the wannabe action hero inside every red-blooded American male.  And to the women who love them.  Any misapprehension that these films are going to take themselves realistically or seriously should be checked at the door.LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD opened Wednesday of this week just in time for the Fourth of July celebration, and to take advantage of the extra-long weekend at the box office. It's the fourth film in the franchise about New York Police Department Detective John McClane, absolutely the toughest cop Hollywood has ever created. In my opinion. Nobody bleeds like McClane bleeds. Or limps. Or talks to himself, delivering a humorous, self-deprecating monologue on how he got into the whole mess he is in.There was some hesitation about whether or not Bruce Willis could pull off the franchise character again. There was no hesitation about the fact that if Bruce Willis could not play McClane, no one else could. Willis the actor and McClane the character are too tightly-knit to allow to anyone else to intrude into the franchise. Maybe other actors can play James Bond and win over a whole new audience, but I can't see that happening with this one. Not as long as Bruce Willis can still walk and talk.After seeing the movie, there's no doubt that Willis - and McClane -are back in a big way. For a while, Willis swore he'd never play the character again. He wanted more serious roles and a chance to stretch as an actor. He's made some good films, and some not so good films, since DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE with Samuel L. Jackson. And while the McClane role is somewhat limiting Willis pulls it off with zest. Maybe he was born to do other things as well, but he was definitely born to be John McClane.Now all the fans are going to be waiting for the next Die Hard movie, although there hasn't been any talk of such. We can only hope.The movie starts out with a bang, the way these things always do. A group of cyber-criminals utilize code and algorithms written by blackboard computer hackers to get into key Federal government installations, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation. They're operating under a man named Thomas Gabriel, who has used enough players in his operation that none of the computer hackers know who they are working for or what they are truly doing.As soon as Gabriel is certain that he's into the computer networks he wants to be into, he gives orders to start the elimination process of all the computer hackers involved. The action turns violent and bloody. Matt Farrell (played brilliantly by Justin Long) is the only one who escapes his fate, and that's only through the direct intervention of McClane.It's been twelve years since the last DIE HARD movie. Those twelve years are reflected in the latest release. McClane has gotten older and his life has moved on. His wife finally left him for good and he's estranged from his son and daughter. He's introduced breaking up his daughter's latest date in a fairly humorous scene.One of the things that was awkwardly handled in the movie was Lucy's - McClane's daughter -sudden change in feelings about her father. Viewers knew it was coming, but it came without true motivation from within. That part felt particularly scripted.When McClane gets the call to go pick up a known computer hacker, the tension immediately ratchets up. In a move that was also very scripted, McClane arrives at Matt's house just in time to keep him from being blown to smithereens. (And you have to wonder why the bad guys simply didn't walk into each of the hackers' houses/apartments and simply shoot them when they were done with them.  The explosions were just to give the special effects crew a warm-up for the action that was coming.)The cat and mouse game begins, with McClane alternately fighting to stay alive and chasing the bad guys. The action sequences are pure dynamite, fueled by adrenaline and testosterone - on part of the characters and the audience. Viewers that are totally into the McClane experience are hard pressed not to hoot and holler in support of their hero's actions and one-liners.Those fans understand that there are glaring plot holes and things that make no sense and in the real world things wouldn't function the way they do in the movie. For instance, the cell phone systems would go down almost immediately as emergency services took them over to use for their own operations. McClane uses a cell phone a lot in the beginning of the movie, as do the terrorists. Those would be the first things shut down. Security on major important network sites, like the eastern seaboard utility control area, would be immediately entrenched in military personnel if the United States government believed it was under attack.But that's beside the point. This film is about action, not about reality. Reality would be much slower paced.As always, McClane ends up being the guy involved in the investigation who gets all the key pieces as to what's really going on. It wouldn't be a DIE HARD movie if he didn't.The concept of the \"fire sale\" in the realms of cyber-terrorism is a real thing. There are a lot of checks and balances to keep it at bay, but it is one of the things the United States government constantly guards against. The movie sells the idea very well.Also, though the franchise isn't known for being cutting-edge or high-tech, there's a lot of the emerging computer technology and integrated systems that are nationwide and international in the film. Justin Long's character introduces all that technology and the concepts behind it in bite-sized chunks that the audience can keep track of in the midst of car chases, gunfights, and serious explosions.I found myself as enthralled by the computer attacks as I was by McClane's usual physical action and banter. There was something so inherently cool about watching the terror-geeks and Matt Ferrell at work on computer systems even though much of it was fake. The idea that it was all possible and would be done in such a way was amazing.But the action - that's the key to every Die Hard film. There's plenty of it in this movie. Is it over the top? No doubt about it! No one - but no one - could walk away from all the damage that McClane takes while doggedly pursuing the bad guys. I lost count of the number of bodies left behind, the number of vehicles that were destroyed in wrecks and explosions, the number of buildings that were leveled, and would have to guess that the number of bullets fired must be in the millions.The most over-the-top sequence in the film is the scene where McClane is driving an eighteen-wheeler through a system of elevated highways while being pursued and fired upon by a military attack jet with hover capability. There is simply no way this could ever happen, or that a truck could suffer that much damage and still keep going. Much less without the driver getting killed.If they do a video game on this movie as they have some of the movies in the past, you can see this sequence being part of the game. It's ludicrous.  It's impossible.  And yet, it's so McClane. And that's what puts the butts in the seats, folks.Maggie Q plays possibly the most lethal lady McClane has ever had the misfortune of crossing paths with. She absolutely tears him apart for a while. And that leads to possibly the second-most over-the-top sequence in the film when the action spreads the elevator shaft. Still, if anybody was gonna do it like this, it has to be rogue cop John McClane.Make no mistake. This film isn't for posterity. This film isn't even close to Academy Award material - except maybe for special effects.What this film is, and where it succeeds so admirably, is an action film starring one of the best action heroes ever invented or portrayed, and played once more by the only actor that could do that character justice. This is superhero action without the cape and the mutant abilities. And this is a hero who's fallible yet impossible to beat.Treat yourself to a summer delight over the holidays. Buy a ticket. Invest heavily in a willing suspension of disbelief at the door. Find a good seat. And prepare to cheer on John McClane one more time as he goes up against impossible - and, admittedly, wildly improbable - odds.", :rating=>5.0, :percentage=>100.0, :useful=>[37, 47], :date=>" 2007 July 1", :title=>"McClane's Back!

The place holds about 5,000 seats\nand it was packed. With an 8:30 start, we got to our seats by 7:30. The movie didn't begin\nuntil 9:30!!! Guess who was late?Julie and I are not particularly big 'Die Hard' fans. And having to\ncatch a train home from Grand Central station at a certain time, we\nboth agreed that if the movie was sub-par, we would split early to get\nhome earlier.So finally the lights go down around 9:20 and out comes Bruce Willis.\nHe respectfully apologized and then started jazzing up the audience for\nthe film. The excitement was palpable as the crowded theater whooped it\nup with Bruce shouting \"Are you ready!!!\" Well, Julie and I were, as we got swept up in the excitement and\ncheered aloud as if we were at the ball game. Even the couple next to\nus, I'd say they were about in their late sixties, dressed very\n'proper', were just as energized. The movie starts and a mere few minutes in, the action explodes. By\ntwenty minutes into the film, Julie and I were sold. Who cares what\ntime we're gonna get home!? I have not had this much fun at the movies since I can't remember when.\nI have always loved summer movies, but only the ones that deliver the\ngoods. The action sequences are top shelf, 21st century movie making\nbrilliance. These explosive scenes are a seamless composite of\nfantastic, real world stunt work, and exceptional CGI. Hands down, they\nmake the film. And for an action movie with 'die hard' in the title,\nI'd say that was the point.It was awesome watching this film with so many people because it was\nlike riding a gigantic roller coaster, with everybody having a shared,\nhair raising experience. People were cheering like when Luke blew up\nthe Death Star. The humor throughout was just right. By the end of the\nfilm, our senses were stunned as we dizzily made our way out of the\ntheater, thoroughly entertained.Excellent summer movie! Well done Bruno and crew!\n*** This review may contain spoilers ****** This review may contain spoilers ****** This review may contain spoilers ****** This review may contain spoilers ****** This

It delivers action in abundance, and the movie has a great\nvisceral feel to it thanks to great stunt work, and the fact that\nWillis really steps up in the fight scenes.

The third one works because you have a bad guy that is out for\nrevenge against John McClane. The fourth one though, it just felt like\nMcClane's character was dropped in as an after thought. I don't think\nyou can just drop John McClane into any story and call it Die Hard and\nthis movie felt more like a Tom Clancy political thriller than a Die\nHard movie.While watching this I at least thought I would let it pass as a generic\naction movie, because I was having fun. However, then I started\nthinking about it and I'm sorry I need even my action movies to at\nleast make a little bit of sense. There was just too much stuff in this\none that didn't work for me. The first problem I had was that the bad\nguys created a giant traffic jam in DC causing congestion everywhere\nexcept of course for the streets they need for the major car chase\nscene. Also during the part of that car chase that took place in the\ntunnel, how come when the bad guy started turning the lights off in the\ntunnel not a single person though to turn their head lights on? However\nthe biggest action scene that bugged me was the scene where John\nMcClane is driving the big rig truck and being chased by the fighter\nplane. This scene was so laughably over the top that it had no place in\na Die Hard movie. I know Die Hard movies are known for their over the\ntop action at some points but I just could not stop laughing at how\ncompletely ridiculous this scene was. Oh and seriously, since when does\nthe 695 beltway around Baltimore have palm trees? OK, that is a bit too\nnitpicky, but it was kind of funny.The film seemed to me to also be extremely inconsistent about whether\nor not cell phones were working. The cell phones weren't working, so he\nreprogrammed the phone to use the old \"satcomm\" satellites instead.\nThen that stopped working and then a little bit later that is working\nagain. Also I'm still amazed at how Kevin Smith's character is still\nable to hack into so much stuff even after all the power on the entire\neastern seaboard has been shut off. I mean seriously there are a lot of\nservers out there that have battery backups and stuff, but a lot of the\nservers he would need to go through to have a good enough connection to\ndo any of the hacking he was doing would have been shut down after the\npower outage. OK, maybe I am picking at too much of the film, but all\nthis bugged me while watching the film and I wasn't able to just sit\nback and get sucked in like I would in any other Die Hard film.The acting in the film for the most part was pretty good, except of\ncourse for the main bad guy. He had one facial expression for the\nentire movie and the tone of his voice never changed. His only way of\nshowing anger was to throw something off his desk. His performance was\nso wooden; it just paled in comparison to Alan Rickman, William Sadler\nand Jeremy Irons, who all three just played wonderful bad guys.The look and feel of the movie didn't feel at all like a Die Hard movie\nto me either. Sure, John McClane takes a good beating like he does in\nall the films but all the action seemed to crisp and clean. It didn't\nfeel nearly as gritty as the previous Die Hard films. Also one of the\nthings I noticed was the film seemed to have this predominantly blue\ncolor scheme going on. It just felt like there was this blue hue\nthrough out the film, where in the previous Die Hard films the\npredominant colors are very earthy and red. I don't know if anyone else\neven knows what I am talking about, but that is just something that I\nnoticed that took away from the gritty Die Hard feeling.\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb",

I loved the first three\nin the series - they are among my favorite action movies of all time.\nWhen I first heard they were making a fourth Die Hard movie I thought -\nAwesome, what a great way to introduce Die Hard to a whole new\ngeneration of fans.What I saw was a laughable mockery of a Die Hard movie. Let me start by\nsaying the first problem was the rating. Turning a series of R rated\ngory action flicks into A PG-13 imitation does not work. It was as if\nFox was trying to pass it off as some type of family friendly movie.\nThis resulted in the film being minimal in bloody action violence,\nminimal in language use, and the use of McClane's staple line - \"Yippee\nKi Yay Mo ******\" was made to be slightly distorted so the last word\n(all Die Hard fans know what it is) was more implied than spoken. The\nrating also had another effect. Since the aspects listed above were\ndownplayed so much, the movie's style didn't come anywhere close to\nmatching the style of the first three. It didn't Feel like Die Hard.(This is off topic, but it reminds me of another time the same company\ntook two GREAT! R rated series - Alien - and Predator - and combined\nthem to make the PG-13 mockery we now know as AVP)I didn't like the villain. The whole movie it didn't seem like he\nhimself really did anything. He didn't really torture or shoot or even\nseverely harm McClane's daughter. He was never really a threat. It was\nalways a henchmen up until the end of the movie. (Unless you count the\nTunnel-Helicopter sequence) Which bugs me, where did all the henchmen\ncome from? In the first and third movies they were German militants,\nand the second movie they were military extremists supportive of\nGeneral Esperanza. It this movie - they were just kind of there. I\nmean, Gabriel was suppose to be a DoD government employee - and he just\npulled a crap load of henchmen out of no where. Were they terrorists?\nWow, nice background check on a government employee with links to\nterrorist organizations if they were.The use of technology was just awful. Specifically what you saw on the\ncomputer screens was unrealistic and felt like some sort of hi tech\nfairy tale to me (being a networking professional). I mean, I had no\nidea hacking was so graphical and straightforward.To close - if the characters weren't making some cheesy quip or not\ndying after smashing through multiple plains of glass and being hit\nwith SUV at one point - they most defiantly were contributing to what\nshould go down in history as a sorry day indeed for the Die Hard\nseries.My advice - pull a matrix and pretend the sequel doesn't exist.\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337978/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"\nI went to see this movie with very high hopes.", :clean_text=>"i went to see this movie with very high hopes", :sentiment=>{:average=>0.43000000000000005, :corrected_average=>0.22, :scores=>[0.2, 0.83, 0.205, 0.485], :total=>1.7200000000000002}, :context_tags=>{}, :context_indexes=>{}, :noun_phrases=>["went", "this movie", "very high hopes"], :people_tags=>[], :people_indexes=>[], :emphasis=>0.2}, {:index=>1, :text=>"I loved the first three\nin the series -

I am regular reader at IMDb for perhaps 5\nyears, but this was the first movie that forced me to get registered\nand write a review of it.*** Warning. Text below may contain spoilers *** Well, not really,\nthere is absolutely no suspense in this movie and it is entirely\npredictable right from the beginning.The movie consists of series of chases and shootouts that are not\nparticularly well choreographed. Plot is virtually nonexistent (in\nother words there are more of the holes that of the plot itself). Willis with his sidekick are dragged from location to location without\nany explanation how and why they got there. The scale of McLane's\nactions increased with each instalment (first saving the staff of a\nskyscraper, then airport, then a city and this time the whole country),\nunfortunately there are 2 issues now. First the whole premise hacking\nand controlling so many different computer systems is ridiculous,\nsecond the threat of terrorists does work at all. They are simply not\nmenacing enough. They are led by \"guy who shut down NORAD just with his laptop\", but\nwhen they shut down traffic in a big city, all they create is few car\naccidents (of the kind that can only happen when people are driving\nwith their minds shut down). Other than police department being swamped\nby citizens (what the hell are they doing there?), not much happens.\nCellphones work, it is possible to move around in a car, no real panic\nvisible, no police presence on streets. Especially response to events\nfrom both citizens and government is not depicted at all. I would like\nto know where the hell was the mighty US Army for entire duration of\nthe movie (apparently still tied down killing civilians in Iraq).There are all sorts of clichés you can imagine: * Computer genius, who\nis at the same time exceedingly naive at the same time, a bit paranoid,\nuttering nonsense all the time and absolutely useless (except he\nmiraculously saves the world in the end). * Another overweight computer\ngenius, who is a bit paranoid, uttering nonsense all the time and\nabsolutely useless. * Supermodel/kung-fu bitch crossover female\nterrorist * Girly main terrorist, who fails to be intimidating at all,\nhe seems he can start crying any minute (I really miss calibre of\nGrubers or Colonel Stuart). * Terrorist masterminds who personally\ninvolve themselves dirty jobs, instead of employing their minions. *\nGeneric industrial locations, which seem completely out of place. *\n1960s sci-fi meets Matrix style computer rooms (I recommend sets\ndesigner to visit real server room next time, reality may look more\nmenacing than this uneducated fantasy). * Cop chief who always seem to\nbe genuinely busy, but he really does nothing in the movie. *\nTerrorists have resources to hack stock exchanges, traffic systems and\nutilities all over U.S. But still, the only thing they can afford to\nstop a poor cop is a chopper and few not particularly well trained guys\nwith assault rifles.Cast There are really only two characters in the movie, all other\npeople appearing in the movie are just faceless bystanders (including\nmain foes) and their performance is not any better than of any random\nbystander watching making of a movie.Willis' performance is pretty generic, he tries to utter the same kind\nof one liners as in previous instalments, sadly most of the time they\nare out of place, badly timed or complete non sense. As the scale has\nbeen upgraded so is the McClane's self confidence who became true\nsuperhero with some supernatural abilities. Expect projecting speeding\ncars into helicopters, walking on a wing of a jet etc. This is in\ncontrast with previous instalments where McClane had been smart guy,\nbut still realistic police officer who happened to be at the wrong\nplace at the wrong time.Long is genuinely B movie actor. His performance is at best bearable.\nHe might be OK, mindless script does not give much space for his\ncharacter.Bottom line: No doubt it is the worst of all 4 Die Hards. I compared it\nto Independence Day it resembles a bit, but in many aspects ID is much\nbetter working. If you like mindless movies filled with explosions, but\ncan do without any coolness factor, then you can try this, everyone\nelse avoid it!disaster (0 out of 5)\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb",

:content=>"\n12 years on; McClane is bald, estranged from his family and feels\nincreasingly like an anachronism. There is a strong 'post-9/11' vibe, a\nmuted color scheme and a strangely sombre tone that permeates\nproceedings. The film covers more terrain (literally) than it's\npredecessors and the action is slightly episodic as a result of\nshoehorning a series of mini-showdowns into a plot about\ncyber-terrorists and an attempt to shut down the US infrastructure.\nIt's handled more deftly and inventively than you might expect, but\nit's not an obvious marriage.The authenticity of the 'hacking' that takes place is also suspect\n(webcam becomes spy-cam in the basement of a security obsessed computer\nnerd?) and there is a horribly misjudged piece of casting in Kevin\nSmith as a stereotypical basement-dwelling, uber-hacker.(he simply\ndoesn't have the acting chops) Having said all of that, the action\nsequences are top-notch; brutal and old-school. (with a couple of nods\nto the 'new', in the form of the stoic but sizzling Maqqie Q and 'le\nparkour' madman Cyril Rafaelli, whose incredible dexterity is captured\nto dazzling effect by Wiseman and crew) The performances are mainly\nstrong, especially Bruce who immediately reminds you that you're\nwatching McClane despite the (slightly) sanitized language and\nvanishing hair. Justin Long is surprisingly engaging as McClane's\nassignment/sidekick in a role which could so easily have been\nirritating, and Olyphant, as the main bad guy, gives an intense and\ncharismatic performance full of understated humor and implied menace.\nHe makes for an interesting antagonist, reminiscent of Rickman's 'Hans\nGruber' in the original; a little less verbose, but a similarly\ncharming sociopath with a formidable, sub-zero stare. Even the\ninclusion of Mary Elizabeth Winstead as McClane's daughter, (another\nmove which, on paper, seemed destined to annoy) works well. She has\ninherited some of her fathers personality traits to frequently amusing\neffect, but the film-makers (wisely) avoid the temptation to give her\nany 'Lara Croft' type abilities in order to appease a wider\ndemographic, a move that would have potentially alienated the core\naudience - even more than the furore over the PG-13 rating.Speaking of the rating, while the film is light on blood and one\nparticular swear-word, the violence hasn't been toned down at all. If\nanything, McClane is actually more hardened and brutal than before.\nEnemies are often dispatched with an efficiency and a ruthlessness\ncommensurate with a man who's done this before. There is also a calm\nresignation in Willis' body language at times. McClane is a man who has\nfound no solace in being a hero; post-divorce and struggling to\nmaintain a relationship with his daughter, (His son is barely\nmentioned) he feels he has lost the things that matter most to him.\nThis is the single most notable change in the film. Gone is the\nwild-eyed, heavy-breathing, frantically pacing McClane of the original\nDie Hard; The man rapping on the windows, desperately trying to signal\nthe fire brigade. Willis communicates this malaise subtly and\neffectively, prompting the Justin Long character to ask at one point;\n'Why are you so calm? Have you done that kinda stuff before?' The\ndirection is astonishingly controlled and confident from the man that\nbought the world 'Underworld' (He may be one to watch after all.) and,\nfor my money, offers the best spectacle of any film this summer.There is a weight and an impact to the stunts and the fight scenes that\ncomes from using actual stunt-work; so often eschewed these days in\nfavor of scenes built entirely on disk.As mentioned, the tone is slightly subdued for a summer actioner\n(despite a good number of amusing lines and a healthy amount of\nself-awareness) which differentiates it from the others in the series.\nThere is a world-weariness amongst the chaos. A meditation on being\n'that guy' is one of the more inspired exchanges, and the greatest\ninsight into McClane's journey through the missing years. As a result,\nthe audience is not left to enjoy the sense of good triumphing over\nevil at the end without at least a little remorse about the meaning of\nit all (It reminded me of one of the great strengths of '24' in that\nregard.). As the credits roll, all may not be right with the world as\nwould be more typical of the genre, but there are other, more personal\ntriumphs to savor. This gives the film a little more depth than the\nprevious sequels, though it takes some of the edge off the 'octane\nbuzz' that the film injects you with.Nevertheless, this remains significantly the best blockbuster of the\nSummer Season. It is the first to truly deliver on all it promised (and\nprobably surpasses realistic expectations) It would require a second\nviewing to determine where it might rank in the series, but it is more\nthan worthy of the name and Die Hard remains, for my money, the\nundisputed champ amongst action franchises. I humbly request one more\ninstallment in which Bruce et al pour heart and soul into creating a\nworthy send-off and then suggest that Bruce let's McClane retire\nundefeated. He'll have earned it.\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337978/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"\n12 years on; McClane is bald, estranged from his family and

Bruce\nseems to have forgotten what the John McClane character is like,\nbecause he doesn't come across the same as he does in the previous 3\nfilms, and is not helped by the poor dialog and cheesy one-liners that\nare poorly timed. All of the other characters are clichés too -\nTimothy's ice cold bad guy, Maggie Q's brainy, beautiful, femme fatale,\nthe FBI head who for some unknown reason can't understand what's going\non or get anything done, but John McClane can work everything out no\nproblem, even without the resources of the whole FBI to help, all he\nneeds is a phone and a gun! - I mean come on people, this is as lazy a\nplot as you could get.Some of the set pieces are OK, but then when the filmmakers go into\noverdrive and have McClane climb onto a moving jet fighter, it all went\nout the window - this is NOT a fantasy movie, I didn't expect to see\nLord of the Rings - so McClane should not be on top of a moving jet\nplane for Christ's sake!

There's plenty of action and drama, and over-the-top stunts and sequences, Willis still has the gusto he used to, and the supporting cast does nice work too. It would have been nice had this been \"hard-edged\" like the previous films, but even though it's not, it's still a decent film.Like the previous entry, this one is on a larger, more open scale, with McClane having to stop a high tech terrorist attack on the country's (mainly eastern seaboard) computer infrastructure using his old school analog ways. Joining him is a dweeby computer guy who makes for a pretty decent comic foil, though he has nothing on Samuel L.

I love this flick, and I just don't get the hate some people have for it.\r\rA movie needs four things to really feel like a true Die Hard movie: Bruce Willis as John McClane, Michael Kamen's musical score, Jan DeBont's cinematography, and a memorable villain. \r\rLive Free or Die Hard has only one of those four things.\r\r...yet despite that fact, I was surprised to find that it is not only a good flick, but probably the best Die Hard movie since the first. Bruce is back in full force as McClane. Marco Beltrami did a phenomenal job of imitating Kamen's scores, even using some of the same themes and musical cues from previous films - This goes a long way toward creating the atmosphere of a Die Hard film. The cinematography seemed a little more modern and slick than previous installments, but they were very smart in avoiding a lot of the modern trends that would have really taken away from the film: Slo-mo is used very sparingly, and the more frenetic action scenes aren't all just quick-cut, shaky-cam, over-edited messes. \r\rThis leaves us with the villain situation. Timothy Olyphant is a good actor who can really steal a scene in the right role. But here he is only given a couple of really meaty moments to shine, and comparing him to classic villainous actors like Alan Rickman and Jeremy Irons is just unfair. So while he does a fine job, his character is not particularly memorable. The rest of the villains are filled out with the usual generic henchman, with the exception of a kung-fu right-hand woman and an overly-acrobatic top thug straight out of a Bond film.\r\rJustin Long has always been a fun, underrated actor in my opinion, but again I was worried he'd come across as a lame comic relief sidekick. Yes, he provides a lot of the laughs for the movie, but he is able to do it in a way that seems natural for his character, and it never seems forced. \r\rI was extremely worried going into this film and had kept my expectations down accordingly.  It's always nice to have high hopes for a film and have that film match your expectations, but to go in and be SO pleasantly surprised is a great feeling. I was grinning though half the movie just because I was so thrilled it was living up to the Die Hard name. The action is exciting and even if they went over-the-top in a couple sequences (the F-35 scene is quite far-fetched and feels like it belongs more in a True Lies movie), it never takes you out of the movie. It's just a great action flick and probably ranks second in the franchise only to the original in my opinion.", :title=>nil, :location=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"rotten_tomatoes",

Live Free Or Die Hard is a fine return to form, and is by far the best Die Hard film since the first one. Bruce Willis is back as maverick cop, John McClane, and boy does he seem determined in this fourth entry of the Die Hard franchise. John McClane hasn't felt this menacing since the first film.  Live Free Or Die Hard, is a different film from all the others, and is a bit risky considering we live in a time where we're vulnerable to terrorists. But it's just plain entertainment. Now before seeing this film, I skeptical, I did sort of enjoy the third entry, but felt it lacked something to truly make it memorable. So I had high hopes for this sequel.  So I saw the film, and I was stunned at what I saw; the film is a fine return to it's action roots, as I felt that the last two sequels had more of a humourous approach, which cheapened the films slightly. But in this fourth film, we have a few of the traditional John McClane wise cracks, but the filmmakers don't overdue it.  This is my favorite Die Hard since the first one, and I enjoy how they managed to do something totally new and refreshing with the overall plot of the franchise. In this fourth entry we have a terrorist who is played marvelously well by Timothy Olymphant who uses techno terrorism to wreak havoc on the United States. Olymphant is very surprising in the role, and he truly is menacing and convincing. I find him quite a hit and miss actor, but with this film he truly delivered one of the best performance since Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber in the first one. Live Free or Die Hard boasts an impressive cast of actors.  This is a phenomenal action film that delivers on the action, and the thrills, Everything that made the first Die Hard great is here, and more. The only difference is, this film is set in the 21st century. The threats are more realistic this time around, and who know with the techno terrorism going on in the film, maybe this will be the face oif terror in the next 50 years.
