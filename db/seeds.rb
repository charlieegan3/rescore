I also loved seeing Tommy Flanagan in a small role here, as I love his current work in the TV series \"Sons of Anarchy\". Another plus for this film was certainly the screenplay. Tons of quotable lines and great speeches really helped to amplify this film. My complaints would likely center around the forced and unnecessary romance. It did not help move the film forward in the least. In terms of providing character history, it works, but as the action unfolds, it no longer really serves a purpose and felt like excess. In addition, the aforementioned slow beginning sequence was not overly to my liking, though I certainly understand why it is there and cannot complain over its conclusion. It simply did not provide the necessary spark to grab the viewers attention in my mind, but regardless, its importance is clear. Other than that, while typically top-notch, the CGI at times was noticeable with some unrealistic deaths along the way, but that is to be expected, as no film is perfect.

However, its appeal and publicity doesn't always match what the actual film delivers, yes this is a story about revenge, the journey of a man who was on the brink of release from the Roman army, a man who won the honour and glory of his fellow soldiers, who battled and won every fight, who was admired by the great, Marcus Aurelius himself. Only too lose everything he holds dear and to be embroiled into gladiator games where he fights to the death and slowly regains his pride and honour to exact revenge on the man who took it all away from him. sound interesting? sure it does do this, but at a cost of being weighed down in political hoohaar and character arks that never really go anywhere until the end (which might I add is probably one of the best directed,acted and moving ending 30 minutes of this century, as of to date) but all that information and back story seems to be lost, the characters that side with Maximus seem to suddenly loose there morals and make an alarmingly unbelievable set of characters, I'm allowed to think this seeing as most of the historical elements are also flawed, yes, the story has to fit in with the history and vis versa, but there are some big inaccuracies here. The story feels dragged and at some points loses all interest in itself, taking away the focus from the \"main promotion\" of the film i.e. the gladiator aspect and sides more with the stale conspiracies and uninteresting characters that control them. Yes, the gladiator games are well choreographed full of action and excitement, but there is a serious lack of it in my opinion, especially for a film that is named \"Gladiator\" and features the main character who becomes a gladiator and participates in the gladiator games should have a predominate feature in the games. Obviously not in this case, this isn't criticism, I just don't understand why the political aspect has to be so major. The soundtrack to this film is one of the best scores produced by Hans Zimmer; especially towards the end. Plus the acting from Russell Crowe as Maximus is fantastic and easily brings the best role here alive with only one other actor Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus coming into the only other position of 2nd place seeing as he is really the only other developed character, not to mention that the rivalry between them is brilliantly played out even if Commodus character falls a little flat, becoming a rather alienated and brash person when it comes to decision making, but Phoenix does a great job of being paranoid. Generally all other characters seem just to fall short of this even through the script is great and well written it doesn't justify any other characters other than Maximus and Commodus, with the exception of Proximo, Lucille and Marcus but they just aren't developed enough to care but Richard Harris does deliver a fine performance. I have to say that the cinematography is amazing in this film, the CGI has stood the test of time and although some scenery and deaths look a bit...well patchy. I have to say the mise-un-scene compliments the ancient Rome style very well and even looks like it was filmed in the original robes. This film isn't a bad film at all, I found it very good, I think that Ridley Scott has made a fine film which has great acting, a decent/fairly interesting story, a well written script and perfect cinematography.

The plot takes you to a world that is possible to imagine and is so easily and well done that you could almost believe that the movie was in fact shot in Ancient Rome. It's so expertly written that I have watched it dozens of times and still enjoy every moment of it. The story adds to the setting, character development, and overall feel of the movie. It's an amazing film as far as storytelling goes. As for the acting I can even appreciate the main villain. He comes off as a whining, simpering lunatic with quite a lot of daddy issues. Most of the time the villain is the one person I find most uninteresting, but this time I did find him interesting and due to this wanted him to die so hard. As for the main role, played by Russel Crowe, Maximus is just the guy. He's the one guy I'd want in case of zombie outbreak. Batman is well and good, but Maximus is better. Batman can abandon you and go and fight the zombies by himself and then when he returns to you he can sit there and do some detective work to try and figure out why leaving you by yourself got you killed. While Maximus will ensure the survival of you, your friends, the kid with you, the dog, the cat, and the donkey you've all got following you. In short...best cinema hero ever. A believable hero too. The settings are just amazing and really suck you into the film. Every piece, every segment looks like something you would see in Ancient Rome. From the coliseum to the streets of Rome you're made to believe that they're all in an accurately depicted ancient civilization. Not to mention the costuming also plays a big role in giving you that feel. No one is dressed out of place and the costumes due the timeline and the movie honest justice. The music is amazing, and it stands out when it needs to, and fades to the back when it needs to. They did very well on that part and unlike many movies that just like to park trumpets in your face and blow your eardrums up this one has none of that. They did their music well and come on...I love Enya. In the end this is a beautiful, touching, gorgeous movie that's all heart. It had me crying my eyeballs out, and also got me thrilled.

Great Writing!  Great Acting!  Great Directing!  Great Score!\nThis movie has it all.  I especially enjoyed the mood of the film.  Even\nthough it has a lot of action, there is a subtle elegance throughout the\npicture that gives it great style.  The movie flows effortlessly from scene\nto scene, while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and\nnail-biting excitement.The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations.  Russell Crowe\nis brilliant in his role as Maximus, the \"general who became a slave, who\nbecame a gladiator, who defied an emperor.\"  Crowe's intense style is\nperfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus.  Joaquin\nPhoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus, the corrupt emperor.\nHe plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by\nshowing certain vulnerable or fragile sides, while at the same time\ninstantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character\nshine.  It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works\nperfectly with his role.Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla.  However, perhaps the two\nfinest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans\nin supporting roles.  Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in\nwhat will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their\ncareers.  Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius, the aging Caesar who\nreflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And\nReed, especially, gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as\nProximo, the trainer for the gladiators.  The way he spoke about the life of\na gladiator, the splendor of Rome, and the \"thrill of the Coliseum\" really\nadded excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see\nmore than once to fully appreciate.  The excitement felt for me when Rome is\nfirst shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene.  But the\nwhole movie is a rush!  Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to\ncapture the different moods in the movie.  Ridley Scott sets the perfect\ntone with his artistic and creative directing.  I would recommend it to\nanyone who can stomach intensity and enjoy an epic story for the ages.

over Germania in the beginning of the movie. The dying\nemperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius, is watching this battle.The emperor's son, Commodus, then arrives with his sister Lucilla, and it is\ndiscovered that Commodus fully expects to be announced the new emperor of\nRome in a few days. Aurelius, however, has other plans--he wants to make\nMaximus emperor, and requests that of the general, who wants nothing more\nthan to go home to his family.I went into this movie having just watched Ben-Hur in my film studies class\nand having watched an episode of Xena only a couple of weeks earlier that\nfeatured the story of Marc Anthony and Cleopatra. So you could say I was in\nthe perfect mindset to watch a \"sword-and-sandal\" movie. I wasn't sure what\nto expect, having somehow avoided all the hype that accompanied this movie.\nBut I was not disappointed.Gladiator features some wonderful cinematography by John Mathieson. The\nbattle scenes are very graphic. (This movie is not for the squeamish, that's\nfor sure.) There were some scenes in particular that really struck me, such\nas when Crowe appears to be floating over the ground very fast.  The use of\ncolor and color tones added a great deal to the mood of the movie.\nExcellent.The script was being written and re-written as the filming was going on, yet\nit doesn't show that the actors had no idea how the movie was going to end\nwhen they began filming.  The acting is terrific. Russell Crowe is\nwonderfully cast as Maximus. Many reviewers agree that he is now officially\na star. Joaquin Phoenix also proves his mettle as the emotionally troubled\nCommodus, whose behavior and emotion toward his sister could give anyone the\ncreeps. Connie Nielsen makes you believe that, as Lucilla, she really is\ntorn between natural loyalty to her brother and doing what she knows is\nright. Oliver Reed, in his last performance, is memorable in his role of\nProximo, the former gladiator who is the owner of Maximus and brings him to\nRome.  In short, the actors were brilliant in their roles, not over-acting,\nbut giving subtle, strong performances.The script itself is very good.  Although some elements are a little hard to\nbelieve--the fact that no one recognizes Maximus when he's a slave?--this\nfilm calls for a willing suspension of disbelief, which one would happily\ncomply with.  (It's really no fun to nitpick such a movie.)It's true that this movie does pretty much follow the Braveheart formula.\nHowever, this movie includes some elements, such as the cinematography and\nthe incredibly graphic battle scenes (one reviewer likened it to Saving\nPrivate Ryan, \"only better\"), that are spectacular in itself. Overall, a\ngreat movie that I highly recommend.\n\n", :source=>{:vendor=>"imdb", :url=>"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172495/"}, :rescore_review=>[{:index=>0, :text=>"\n\nThe movie is the story of

returns with the 21st Century's answer to Cecil B\nDeMille, Ridley Scott and his dramatic tale of courage and revenge,\nGLADIATOR - \"the general who became a slave, the slave who became a\ngladiator, the gladiator who defied an emperor\".Once a great roman General, and as good as adopted son of Marcus Aurelius\nCaesar (Harris), Maximus (Crowe) is forced into exile by Commodus (Phoenix),\nheir to the throne, after the death of Marcus. Saved from death by slavers,\nhe is purchased for use as a gladiator by Proximo (Reed) and ends up in the\narena of all arena's, the Colloseum, where he proves unbeatable under his\nguise as \"The Spaniard\".And with a budget of over $100m, Scott certainly delivers the goods.\nGLADIATOR transcends the notion of 'blockbuster' that we have become\naccustomed to in the age of electronic and special effects wizardry and\ninstead offers a good old fashioned action film along the lines of Spartacus\nand and Ben Hur. Not only are we drawn into an archetypal story that\ncontains all the classic elements a filmgoer could dream of (love, loss,\ncourage, despair, good triumphing over evil etc etc) - also on offer is a\nvisual feast of cinematic painting after painting - a rich tapestry of\nimages that are breathtaking and ultimately visually satisfying. From the\nplains of Germania, to the desert stronghold of Zuchobar, and finally to\ngreat Rome herself, John Mathiesion, the cinematographer is to be commended\nhighly for his general inventiveness and ability to capture so much on film.\nThe opening  battle scene is superb as a cast of thousands erupt across the\nscreen and provide an indication that we are about to see a film that pays\nincredible attention to detail throughout its entirety. In every way, Scott\nhas created a world for us that scuttles films of similar epic undertakings\n(and budgets!) and sends them to their dooms at the bottom of the murky\ndepths of film history where they belong.The cast is generally very strong. Crowe proves himself very suitable to the\ntask with a great\nemotional range and depth of character. His accent ocassionally bugged me\n(as did the mish mash of accents on offer - but that is I guess a legacy of\n'internationally casted films'), but this aside, he was well and truly up to\nthe task. Phoenix is also excellent as the disturbed Commodus, as is Nielson\nas Lucilla, the daughter of Marcus who \"should have been a son\" and finds\nherself torn between loyalty to her brother and doing what is 'right'. The\nold guard thesps of Harris, Reed and Jacobi (Grachus) are uniformly strong\nas supporting characters, and Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) does a fine job\nas the young heir to the throne.Add to this great cast excellent editing and post production work, and an\nintricate soundscape (including a magnificent Hans Zimmer score), and you\nhave a film that, despite its length, was highly palatable and had me in\nthere from beginning to end.

It went on to win 5 Oscars (including Best Picture) and received a further 7 nominations. This only added to my feelings of resentment towards it.As a result, I chose to avoid seeing it again and didn't mince my words on my dislike for it. However, plenty of people - who's opinions I respect - seemed to love it. For that reason, I chose to have a reappraisal. During the days of the Roman Empire, dedicated soldier Maximus (Russell Crowe) loyally serves the emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). When the emperor is killed, Maximus refuses to transfer his loyalty to his son and new emperor, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and suffers the consequences. He is ordered to be killed but manages to escape, ending up in the hands of slave trader Proximo (Oliver Reed), who pits him into the Roman Colosseum as a gladiator. It's here that Maximus realises he can still use the arena and the crowd to his benefit and plan his revenge on Commodus. On only my second viewing of this film, my opinion has changed and changed for the better. I still have issues with it but it's granduer is undeniably impressive and as a slice of entertainment it can't be faulted. I can honestly admit now, that my scornful opinion of this film was slightly unjust. It was much better than I remember but still not the classic it's proclaimed to be. For a start, it has a high tendency for melodrama. This is acceptable in some cases but with the acclimations that Gladiator has recieved over the years, I find it needs to be scrutinised a little further. One of the main causes for it's melodramatic approach is some ridiculous dialogue. Reportedly, during production Russell Crowe himself had complaints with screenwriter William Nicholson's dialogue, apparently telling him it was \"garbage\". I found that to be the case in several scenes and when delivering it, the uncomfortableness in the actors looked apparent. However, they manage to carry it well enough; Crowe is a commanding presence in his Oscar winning role but it's by no means his best performance. I think his abilities were better tested the year before in \"The Insider\", where he was absolutely superb and deserved the Oscar then. Phoenix is another actor I admire and he also delivers a good performance but unfortunately suffers with a poorly written and stereotypical character. He's no more than a cartoon villain - complete with dark eye shadow - and he couldn't really get any more nasty. Old hands, Harris and Reed phone their performances in and it looks as if Reed is just there for the beer tokens. Jacobi, however brief, shows his thespian abilities and the always excellent Djimon Hounsou is wasted in another poorly written role. There's not a lot going on for the character's as ultimately, this is all about the spectacle. And a fine, grandiose one it is. With \"Blade Runner\" and most recently \"Prometheus\", Scott has never been known to scrimp on the visual front and this is no different. It is exquisitely detailed (kudos to cinematographer John Mathieson) and filmed in the grandest of scales. The director can't be faulted in his ability to capture the hearts and minds of an audience and this is no more apparent than the impressively choreographed battle scenes and wonderfully ethereal afterlife sequences - shot with a highly artistic eye. Such scenes are afforded a greater power by a superb score from Hans Zimmer and the amazing vocal talents of Lisa Gerrard (for those unaware, check out her beautiful work with Australian outfit \"Dead Can Dance\"). On a visual and audio front, this film can't be reckoned with but unfortunately, I found it to succumb to formula. Despite the fact that the real life Commodus did actually fight in the the gladiatorial arena, the ending stretched credulity for me but I suppose dramatic license is commonplace in film's of this type. I enjoyed this a far-sight more than I used to, as it's undeniably epic and visually arresting. Essentially though, this is an action movie. A good one but not much more than an action movie dressed in the Emperor's clothes.", :title=>nil, :location=>nil, :source=>{:vendor=>"rotten_tomatoes",
