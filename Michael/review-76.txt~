Once again Pixar proves to be a giant among it's peers! 'Wall E' is nothing short of amazing and steps outside it's "kiddies movie" boundaries with this smart and endearing Sci-Fi love story! While the film is short on dialogue, it does not suffer from having nothing to say! It's amazing(there goes that word again!)how much is said without the use of "words" in this beautiful and poignant film.Not since R2 D2 stole the show in 'A New Hope' has a little robot had so much character and charm. Wall E says little, but his feelings are so well conveyed you won't miss one heartbeat! Besides having many great and lovable characters, the animation is truly breathtaking. The story may be a little too deep a satire for small children to truly understand, but they will fall in love with the characters anyway.This is one of the greatest Sci-Fi films ever made bar none! It's a monumental achievement on every level and Pixar should be very proud of their new baby!......It's just fantastic! I can't wait to watch it again and I will this weekend. 

The 3 disc set is wonderful with so many great treasures to uncover and a beautiful DVD transfer to boot. Wall E is nothing short of spectacular and it should be up for Academy Awards across the board!****ONE SIDE NOTE**** My copy had problems playing for the first half hour or so, I'm waiting for a replacement to see if it's an isolated case or the entire batch of DVD's is bad, I will add the information once I know more, it would be tragic if this fantastic movie's release is defective by design!****DVD UPDATE**** I bought a single disc edition and it played perfectly, I am going to buy another 3 disc edition to see if I it's defective. I will add when I know more.****NEWEST DVD UPDATE**** I received my replacement for the 3 disc and it is defective as well! I guess I'm going to keep the single disc. Too bad. The 3 disc has some great material on it.The defective disc does play perfectly in some of my DVD players while not so well in my home theater Denon 3910 machine!? I have had this problem with only a hand full of discs,1)Casino 10th anniversary2)Hammer box set(Evil Of Frankenstein)3)Rodan(new 2 disc edition released with War Of The Gargantuas which plays perfectly?)4)Wall E (3 disc version not sure if the 1 disc version has the same problem?)I hope Disney is going to correct this problem and offer replacements.
