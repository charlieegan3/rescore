The movie itself is awesome.The disney "digital file" on the other hand is lacking.  This review would be 5 stars if the digital file wasn't so crippled.  You can only transfer it once from the CD to your laptop/computer.  And then you can only transfer it once from there to your digital device.  If you lose your code, out of luck, call Disney.  If your computer crashes and you lose your digital file, out of luck, you can't even call Disney.  If your download didn't work from the CD to computer, out of luck again.
