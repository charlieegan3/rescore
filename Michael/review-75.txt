This is the perfect movie for insomniacs. Or people who actually LIKE Thomas Pynchon novels. Only two things will disturb your rest. Josh Brolin, in his relatively limited screen time, manages to inject actual energy into his role. It's worth staying awake to see him. And, of course, Katherine Waterston bares all, and that will surely wake you up. Personally, I was glad when I needed to leave the theater for a while and use the facilities. The folks selling popcorn and soda pop were more engaged than anyone on screen ('ceptin' Brolin, of course).
