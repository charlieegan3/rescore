Pixar produces amazing movies, but WALL-E is for the ages. This original motion picture opens with WALL-E, voiced by Ben Burtt, making his way through a desolate wasteland that is our planet. Humans left 700 years ago because pollution and trash made Earth uninhabitable. WALL-E is the last Waste Allocation Load Lifter - Earth Class robot left on earth. His job is to clean up the planet, while the humans are away. Curiously enough, WALL-E developed a personality, skillfully communicated through emotional-laden beeps, whistles and other noises.Shortly after we're introduced to WALL-E, we meet EVE, voiced by Elissa Knight. EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) was sent by the humans to search for plant life on the planet. WALL-E soon finds himself enamored with EVE, who eventually reciprocates his feelings. WALL-E shows EVE a plant he has found and EVE shuts down to await the arrival of a ship to bring the plant to the humans. Faced with the possibility of losing EVE, WALL-E sneaks aboard the ship and in doing so alters humanity's future. You'll have to see the movie to find out what happens.Whistling, whirring robots...seems silly right? Well, Pixar produced a romantic science fiction thriller that is unlike any other movie created. Seriously, you will come to love these characters, feel their pains and end up rooting for their success. Kids will appreciate the story, and adults will understand the movie's nod to environmental issues, politics and the consequence of human complacency.

This movie came out years ago, so what makes this one different?The only update is the artwork.The actual content is the same as the previous releases including the BURN*E short etc. The combo pack is made for region A, which includes Americas, East and Southeast Asia, U.S. territories, Bermuda.For all intents and purposes, Disney*Pixar is taking a blue-ray movie that didn't come with a DVD copy previously and adding a DVD copy. Disney is no longer including a digital copy like previous releases because eventually those codes expire. Current Disney policy states the unique digital code is good for one year from the release date of a movie. At this time, Disney is honoring expired codes. Disney needs to eventually phase out versions of their movies with expiring digital codes or change the expiration date for codes, so future buyers don't get upset if a code doesn't work.The fact the combo contains blue-ray and a regular dvd is an incentive to purchase if you have have a dvd player in one room and a blue-ray in another and you want flexibility. Perhaps you're like me and you have a blue-ray player at home, but you bring DVDs on the road for a hotel room or your laptop. Or you are looking to upgrade to blue-ray in the future.If you're in the market for blue-ray, the combo dvd/blue-ray discs, Wall-E (Three-Disc Blu-ray / DVD Combo) is actually a $1 cheaper than the blue-ray disc only product, Wall-E (Two-Disc and BD Live) [Blu-ray].
